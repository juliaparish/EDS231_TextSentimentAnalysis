How untrue — and demonstrably so, as the following recipe will show!

A fresh-caught bluefish of moderate weight, quickly cleaned and kept on ice, is as fine an eating fish as American waters produce. Alan Davidson, the British seafood don, says much the same in his indispensable “North Atlantic Seafood,” albeit in a different accent: “It does not keep very well,” reads Davidson’s entry for Pomatomus saltatrix, “but, if bought and cooked with dispatch, offers firm flesh of an excellent taste.” Bluefish, in short, is an excellent protein.

(Vintage International, $14.95.) In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel , a man and his young son travel across the wretched landscape of a post-apocalyptic world. A nuclear holocaust has reduced everything to ash — clocks stopped at 1:17; the sky opened with “a long shear of light and then a series of low concussions” — and the survivors must kill or be killed (and eaten). As winter approaches, McCarthy’s unnamed heroes scavenge their way south to the Gulf Coast, encountering all manner of perils and remnants of the lost world. In the Book Review, William Kennedy called this terrifying parable “consistently brilliant in its imagining of the posthumous condition of nature and civilization.” ",NA,NA,The New York Times,,,2007-05-27T09:00:00+0000,article,BookReview,Books,News,nyt://article/d6ee8fae-4d63-5782-af47-90cace5afb4e,795,nyt://article/d6ee8fae-4d63-5782-af47-90cace5afb4e,NA,Book Review,Paperback Row,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,By Ihsan Taylor,,NA,417,220,25

The main ingredients: one whole goat from the McCormack Ranch in Rio Vista, Calif.; several crates of seasonal produce (and a case of olive oil) from Hudson Ranch in Napa; a basket of morels and porcini gathered near Mount Shasta; an assortment of spices from Boulettes Larder in San Francisco; and a couple of cases of wine from Kermit Lynch in Berkeley. The setting: a shady backyard in Napa (but picture suburban subdivision, not vineyard estate), where a big country table stretches out beneath the canopy of a mulberry tree. The cast: three accomplished Bay Area chefs (Mike and Jenny Emanuel — whose kitchen and backyard we’ve commandeered for the weekend — and Melissa Fernandez), one gifted baker (Chad Robertson), one jack of all culinary trades (Anthony Tassinello) and two amateurs (me and my 17-year-old son, Isaac). The guests: all of the above, plus a rotating crew of spouses, children, friends and neighbors. The fire: almond, oak and mulberry logs burning in a cob oven that Mike Emanuel built with the help of some friends in 2006. A cob, or earth, oven is a primitive, domed cooking device that can be made from layers of mud, clay, straw, stucco, even manure; the earthy mixture, the cob, can endure much higher heat, and hold it much longer, than an indoor oven can. Emanuel’s incarnation, which he built “to bring together family and friends for extended feasts,” stands 5 feet tall with a 30-inch hearth and looks like a cartoon character: a visitor from a planet of chubby, eyeless, big-mouthed monsters.",MM,48,The New York Times,,,2010-10-06T12:37:53+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/ccecf9a2-92ee-50f3-8890-743ff98005da,4267,nyt://article/ccecf9a2-92ee-50f3-8890-743ff98005da,NA,NA,The 36-Hour Dinner Party,Communal Table,NA,The 36-Hour Dinner Party,NA,NA,NA,By Michael Pollan,,NA,417,340,68

Whether or not Irving Penn heard this advice early enough in his career to make any difference, he followed its principles to the letter — he seldom seems to have shot any subject farther away than about 10 feet. He made his living and his initial reputation from fashion and advertising photography, which is to say portraits and still lifes, while on his own initiative he made more portraits and still lifes. He respected and followed both fine-art and vernacular traditions, taking the mottled gray backdrop of early studio photography and making it his own. He discovered a daylight studio in Cuzco, Peru, in 1948 and rented it for a week, shooting locals, and then set up daylight studios of his own in Paris, London and New York to photograph people in the generally doomed small trades (glaziers, tinkers, rag and bone men) in their get-ups and with their accouterments — a motif dating back to the mid-19th century.",BR,56,The New York Times,,,2017-11-28T10:00:26+0000,article,BookReview,Books,News,nyt://article/5daf8c98-3dc2-58e2-af02-bbfedd2612e7,2025,nyt://article/5daf8c98-3dc2-58e2-af02-bbfedd2612e7,NA,Book Review,A Spotlight on the Season’s Top Photography Books,Roundup,NA,Photography,NA,NA,NA,By Luc Sante,,NA,417,380,74

The village is on the front line that separates forces of the Ukrainian military from those of a secessionist statelet that calls itself the Donetsk People’s Republic. Backed by Russia, the D.P.R. has been at war with Ukraine for nearly eight years. Its fighters fire on the Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainians fire back. Or vice versa. No ground is taken, none ceded. The combatants rarely set eyes on one another. Rockets miss their targets and land in Pisky instead, the explosions echoing through the frames of the already-shattered homes and what was once the nave of the church. The priest fled years ago.
