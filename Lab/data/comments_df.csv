Re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, Comments by Air Alliance Houston

Dear Mr. Lee:

Thank you for this opportunity to submit comments on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework and
for EPA’s engagement with Air Alliance Houston and others over the last few months. We appreciate the
effort and the opportunity.

In addition to these comments, Air Alliance Houston endorses comments made by Earthjustice and
assented to by many of our peer organizations across the nation. These comments are the result of
superior work by our colleagues and are deserving of significant weight and attention.

I.       Deepening environmental justice practice within EPA

         A.      Rulemaking

There are several barriers to community participation in rulemaking. These include:

        Inadequate notice
        Limited opportunities and routes for public participation
        Lack of technical knowledge
        Limited access to experts
        Cost of travel, lost work time, etc.

Public participation in the recent Refinery Rule, with its thousands of comments and hearings in Galena
Park, TX and Wilmington, CA, is the EPA’s best and most recent example of strong public participation in
rulemaking.

The public hearings in particular were very useful. They were held in prominent EJ communities and
garnered significant attention from the public, the media, and EPA rule writers. Face to face
communication with fenceline community residents provides the best and most immediate opportunity




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                7
 for public participation. This is particularly true of citizens who do not have the luxury of participating for
months or years in every step of a protracted rulemaking process.

Success in public participation should be measured not by number of comments, written or oral, but by
changes made to a proposed rule in response to public comment. Although the Refinery Rule was the
subject of a robust public participation process, we will wait to see the final rule to decide whether it
was an effective process.

EPA should endeavor to engage communities in every step of the rulemaking process. Public
participation should begin even before a draft rule is proposed. In the Refinery Rule, the proposed rule
was taken as a starting point for public participation, and success will be measured on changes—positive
or negative—to the proposed rule. If public involvement had begun sooner, we might have started with
a proposal that was more responsive to community concerns.

It should be said that one of the reasons the refinery rule hearings were a success was that the rule is a
major one that will have a big impact on air pollution and public health. National organizations such as
Earthjustice were deeply involved in the public participation process, assisting local organizations like Air
Alliance Houston and Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services by organizing planning calls,
producing fact sheets, and arranging travel. We were fortunate to have the assistance of these groups
for this rule, but not every rulemaking will be as significant and garner as much national attention.

           B.      Permitting

Texas likely presents EPA’s biggest challenge in ensuring compliance with federal permitting
requirements. Texas has more permitted facilities than almost any other state. Texas has also openly
defied EPA on many rules, from the greenhouse gas permitting to the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule.

The sheer number of facilities in Texas means that EPA is likely missing many facilities that are skirting
federal law. Flexible permits are also being used in Texas to conduct major modifications without federal
permit review. One way for EPA to promote environmental justice in Texas is to ensure that all facilities
are obtaining federally required permits and conducting appropriate Title V reviews before undertaking
modifications.

The Contested Case Hearing (CCH) process in Texas has historically provided citizens with a useful
mechanism to challenge state permits. The few permits that go through a CCH each year are improved
and receive more public support. But this process is being systematically weakened by state lawmakers.
As Texas erodes opportunities for public participation in permitting, EPA must compensate.

As with rulemaking, lack of public notice and limited resources limit opportunities for meaningful public
participation in the permitting process. EPA should provide resources to aid EJ communities in
participation, by for example providing free access to experts such as lawyers, modelers, and
toxicologists. Finally, EPA has an incredible resource in the National Environmental Justice Advisory
Council (NEJAC). EPA should give strong consideration to the NEJAC’s recommendations on
incorporating EJ in permitting.1 We concur with their recommendations, particularly as follows:

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                           8
           EPA should provide guidance to permit applicants as to what the applicant should do to support
           full community engagement in review procedures.
          EPA needs to educate community members and organization leaders on the effect of EPA policy
           on local decisions, and help community members develop the capacity to engage the federal
           environmental policy effort.
          EPA regions should take the initiative to schedule public meetings with the community to
           enhance their knowledge of the proposed activity.
          EPA should clarify specific roles for states and tribes relative to EPA’s permitting.
          EPA, in collaboration with the permit applicant, should actively listen to and learn from the
           community about past pollution, rather than insisting past pollution is out of the new permit’s
           scope.
          EPA should provide inducements and/or incentives to states to adopt any program which
           enhances the ability of communities to be involved with permit actions in their communities.

           C.      Compliance and Enforcement

Again, because of the sheer size of Texas and its industry, compliance and enforcement presents a
greater challenge to EPA here than perhaps any other state.

Very few polluting facilities in Texas receive any penalty for their violations. State enforcement actions
often resolve years of violations with “sweetheart deals” that provide no incentive for future
compliance. In a recent example, the Sierra Club and Environment Texas calculated a potential penalty
of $641 million for eight years of Clean Air Act violations at the ExxonMobil facility in Baytown. The
district court judge in that case found that TCEQ penalties of only a few tens of thousands of dollars had
resolved these violations. When billion dollar companies receive fines in the tens or hundreds of
thousands of dollars for years of violations, there is no economic incentive not to pollute. Enforcement
should be used to create that incentive.

Texas has a sophisticated system of electronic reporting of violations known as STEERS, the State of
Texas Environmental Electronic Reporting System.2 Anyone can search STEERS and find unenforced
violations from just about any facility in the state. This is a powerful tool that enables such things as
Clean Air Act citizen suits. Other states should follow Texas’ model to make emissions information
publicly accessible in a timely manner.

In Texas, STEERS serves as a stark reminder of how often violations of the law go unenforced. No one
wants the federal government to step in and become the chief regulatory authority in Texas, but it is
hard to see how local authorities are ever going to provide enforcement that is adequate to deter
companies from making an economic decision to pollute. These decisions are easier to make in
environmental justice communities that put up little to no resistance to illegal activity by industry.

           D.      Enhance science tools

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                     9
 For years EPA has vocally promoted community based participatory research (CBPR) and citizen science.
But EPA has not provided a clear path for consideration of citizen-gathered data. Quite the opposite:
EPA has ignored citizen data on many occasions.

Air Alliance Houston has conducted a number of citizen science projects in the last few years. We
completed a two-year CBPR project in Galena Park, Texas that included collection of 29 samples of fine
particulate matter (PM2.5) using a MiniVol Tactical Air Sampler. One aim of the project was to
determine whether the Clinton Drive PM2.5 regulatory monitoring site was representative of PM2.5
levels throughout the community. Data collected showed an average PM2.5 concentration over 15
µg/m3, well over the design value of 12.0 µg/m3.3 In comments to the PM2.5 designation request, we
objected to the use to exceptional events to keep Clinton Drive below the design value and raised a
serious question whether the Clinton Drive monitor was representative of community exposure, using
our CBPR data as evidence.4 The response from EPA was as curt as it was dismissive:

        With regard to whether the data collected by Air Alliance Houston indicates a violation, Region 6
        evaluated the monitoring data submitted by the commenter. Approximately 29 discrete samples
        were collected in the Galena Park community over a 16-month period from May 2012 through
        September 2013, thus the data is limited in scope compared to the data collected by regulatory
        monitors over a 3-year period and subject to data completion criteria. Additionally, these data
        were also not monitored and collected according to the requirements of the federal reference
        method for PM2.5 found in 40 CFR part 50, Appendix L. Our designations must be based on valid
        3-year design values, and even if the monitoring data submitted by the commenters fully
        complied with the siting and data quality criteria, there are not sufficient data on which to
        derive a valid, 3-year design value.

        Therefore, these data do not affect our decision to designate the area as
        Unclassifiable/Attainment.5

This comment suggests that only federal reference method data will be considered by EPA in the
designation process. However, there are many steps EPA could have taken short of designating the area
based on Air Alliance Houston data. EPA could have added a regulatory monitor in Galena Park, or
moved the Clinton Drive monitor to a new location. EPA’s failure to react to this data at all is truly
discouraging for an organization committed to community based participatory research.

Air Alliance Houston is also exploring technologies such as new data visualizations,6 personal air
monitors, and next generation monitoring technology. These technologies are moving quickly, and
regulators are not keeping pace. There is no clear route to submit data to federal regulators. A tiered
system of data submission should be created to accept all data and give it the weight it deserves. This
tiered system would align with the EPA’s goal of integrating EJ into the EPA’s Research Enterprise and
potentially the EPA Office of Research and Development’s Health Disparity investigation.

At the most recent Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (CAAAC) meeting, we were told that EPA would
essentially like to rate all of the available monitoring equipment and create a library of techniques that

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                       10
 citizens can use. This will be a good step, but a rating system or library created through a formal process
will always lag behind the technology by several years. From our perspective, we need a standardized
submission process that accepts data of any kind, evaluates it, and affords it the weight it deserves. The
CBPR process would be more empowering for communities if there were a clear endpoint such as a
formal submission to and response from EPA.

The data we collect with tedlar bags and AirBeams will never be given equal footing with FRM data, nor
should it. Most communities would be satisfied if their research was considered as a factor in decisions
about where resources are needed. Data could influence decisions about which facilities to monitor for
enforcement and compliance, where to give community grants, and where to apply federal monitoring
resources. There are already examples of this happening organically. In Louisiana, for example, the
iWitness pollution map7 is reviewed weekly by state regulatory officials. Pollution reports made by
citizens via the iWitness map are factored into decisions about compliance and enforcement efforts.

There is a great deal of anxiety from the regulated community about how citizens will make use of
better tools and more data. The discussion about EJSCREEN at the most recent CAAAC meeting was an
example of this. CAAAC representatives from industry were very concerned that citizens would misuse
data from EJSCREEN. Other examples come from Texas. Our state agency the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality does not agree that citizens deserve unfettered access to information about air
pollution. This is why the TCEQ refused to participate in the Village Green monitoring program, and it is
why they have refused to publicly acknowledge the existence of houstoncleanairnetwork.com.

We simply cannot understand this fear. The idea that citizens would deliberately misuse data is, frankly,
offensive to us. There is an absurd asymmetry of resource and data access between industry and
citizens. In Houston, the industry group Houston Regional Monitoring maintains its own robust private
monitoring network that is not accessible to the public. Citizens who complain about lack of access to
information are brushed aside. Citizens who present data they have gathered themselves are dismissed
or derided for their efforts. That data exists and is not accessible to the public is a huge environmental
injustice. This is the information age, and every attempt should be made to provide as much information
as possible to anyone who can make use of it. This is the direction the world is moving, and it is
important that regulators move with it.

II.        Collaborate with Partners

           A.       Collaborate with states, tribes, local governments

Texas has sued the EPA 21 times since President Obama took office. This adversarial relationship is likely
to continue, and the best example we have of the state/federal relationship bearing fruit in Texas comes
from the recent spat over greenhouse gas permitting.

After our previous governor declared that Texas would never issue greenhouse gas permits, EPA
implemented a FIP and started issuing the permits itself. Neither EPA nor Texas wanted to promulgate a
FIP, but EPA was forced by Texas’ inaction. Once EPA started issuing GHG permits, state lawmakers
passed a law compelling the TCEQ to create a GHG permitting process. This shows that Texas will step
forward if the alternative is regulation by EPA. Although we would prefer that Texas not act only under
the threat of EPA action, if that threat is effective, it should be used when necessary.

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                  11
 Most states do not have dedicated environmental justice staff people. TCEQ dedicates one quarter of
one full time employee to environmental justice (which it calls “environmental equity”). Personally, we
have not seen that employee at any environmental justice event hosted by EPA. Our research indicates
that many states do not have a dedicated EJ representative or staff, including Arkansas, Kansas,
Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Some other states including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, and
New York do have EJ staff and offices. EPA should encourage states that do not have EJ offices and staff
to create them.

In Region 6, the EJ training sessions held in each state have proven incredibly valuable. Air Alliance
Houston staff has attended all of the Region 6 EJ training sessions held under Regional Administrator
Ron Curry, including in Albuquerque, NM; New Orleans, LA; Houston, TX; and Little Rock, AR. The impact
of these trainings cannot be overstated. They provide EJ activists and EJ community members with the
opportunity to engage EPA officials in person. (Most trainings have not included state-level
representatives, with the exception of Arkansas DEQ, likely for the reason cited above—lack of EJ staff.)
These sessions allow the EJ community to better understand the agency’s inner processes,
requirements, and limitations. In addition, grassroots organizations and EJ community leaders from all
over the region are able to share insights, resources, and collaborate on a greater scale and scope. This
adds substantial leverage to the Region 6 EPA office when addressing region-wide priorities. Air Alliance
Houston strongly recommends that these EJ trainings continue and that the other Regions have them as
well.

It is our understanding that Region 6 intends to develop a state EJ plan for each state. We support this
goal and urge EPA to engage community members early in the process.

        B.       Work with other federal agencies

It is important that the principles of environmental justice are followed by all federal agencies, not just
the EPA. Last year, we experienced a successful interagency action in the Chemical Safety and Security
Working Group. That group held listening sessions in Texas City, TX and Houston that included
representatives from EPA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the Coast Guard, and others.

Chemical safety and security, like EJ, is an issue whose breadth and depth demand cross-agency
cooperation. Although we have not seen the recommendations of the working group or any follow up
action, we are eager to see what the group produces. Other agencies that we would expect to be
involved in EJ work include the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Federal
Railroad Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security.

EJ communities also need assistance with finding and taking advantage of federal resources. We are
aware of a few programs within EPA, including the EJ Small Grant, the Collaborative Problem Solving
grant, and the Building Blocks for Sustainable Communities program. Most EJ community members
probably do not know about these opportunities or have any idea where to begin to take advantage of
them. There are also probably many other potential resources within other federal agencies that we do
not know about. EPA should create a single resource for communities to learn about all available
opportunities and provide assistance with application and administration.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                       12
 There is a perception on the Texas Gulf Coast that our communities are underrepresented in federal
resource allocation. Whether or not this is true, it is a perception that discourages communities on the
third coast from pursuing federal funding. In Region 6, regional conferences or calls always include
participants who know little or nothing about EPA or other federal grants or assistance programs.
Federal authorities and EJ leaders should work together to apply federal resources where they are
needed and provide equal opportunity for all communities. If EJ leaders know about these opportunities
and bring them to their communities, then regional EJ discussions would be more productive.

III.    Outcomes that matter to overburdened communities

Similar to rulemaking and permitting, there are barriers to enlisting overburdened communities in
identifying “outcomes that matter.” Communities lack the resources and expertise to evaluate all
potential risks and prioritize certain outcomes. EPA should not decide for communities what “matters,”
but EPA should equip citizens with the tools that they need to adequately assess various outcomes and
make an informed decision about which ones really matter. Our hope is that tools like EJSCREEN will
take us in this direction.

Public involvement early and often in this process will be important. Once certain priority outcomes are
identified, measuring impacts and holding EPA accountable to its commitments will go a long way
toward legitimizing EPA’s role in EJ communities. But again, the years that such commitments take to
see through will limit the involvement of many community members.

The goal of identifying “a few critical nationwide program areas that matter to overburdened
communities” may be problematic if it is taken as an invitation to score only a few high-profile victories.
There certainly are a few issues that are shared concerns across the nation, including chemical safety
and security, hazardous chemicals used in industrial processes and found in consumer products, and
goods movement. Issues like these are clearly of nationwide importance, as they are all already the
subject of ongoing nationwide advocacy campaigns

IV.     Related efforts

Environmental justice is a civil rights issue and should be addressed as such. There have been attempts
by citizens to address environmental justice through lawsuits brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act. They have not been successful to date. We would like to see EPA further the goal of addressing
environmental justice as the civil rights issue that it is.

V.      Conclusion

As is typical for Air Alliance Houston, we encourage EPA to think about the impact, or lack thereof, of
these policies and proposals in Texas. The EPA’s proposed EJ framework is ambitious, but we have
serious concerns about how much of it will proceed in Texas. Texas is “Open for business” and the TCEQ,
the Texas legislature, and the governor consistently place business interests above public health. Our
state has bought in to the false choice between environment and the economy and has enthusiastically
chosen the economy.

We believe the viability, sustainability, and ultimate success of the proposed framework must clarify the
roles of EPA national leadership, EPA regional offices, and state environmental agencies. The sooner the

 EPA establishes the guidance, tools, and executive‐level support, the sooner states will be able to
observe, learn, support, coordinate, follow, and integrate EJ in their daily activities.

anything further, please don’t hesitate to contact Adrian Shelley at 713-528-3779 x2,

       Re:       BNEJ Comments on EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework


               The Business Network for Environmental Justice (“BNEJ”) appreciates the opportunity to
       submit these comments on EPA’s April 15, 2015 Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework (the
       “Draft Framework”), which also includes a list of the Environmental Protection Agency’s
       (“EPA’s”) environmental justice (“EJ”) priorities for 2015. We provide these comments from the
       perspective of a broad cross-section of industry with a vital interest in the Agency’s effective
       pursuit of EJ.

       Background on the BNEJ

              The BNEJ, based at the National Association of Manufacturers, was formed in 1995. It is
       a voluntary organization of businesses, corporations, industry trade associations, industry
       service providers and business groups interested in environmental justice issues. The BNEJ
       believes that all people should be treated fairly under all laws, including environmental laws,
       without discrimination based on race, color or national origin.

                The BNEJ supports open and informed dialogue with citizens about environmental
       decisions that affect local communities. The BNEJ also supports continued systematic, objective
       scientific research into factors affecting human health and the environment, and the use of
       scientifically sound risk assessments in evaluating and prioritizing health and environmental
       risks.

       Overview

               Overall, the BNEJ views the Draft Framework as a useful exercise in priority-setting. In
       particular, the BNEJ shares the Agency’s goal of making “a visible difference in environmentally
       overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities.” The BNEJ suggests
       below, in the body of these comments, several ways in which EPA can strengthen the Draft
       Framework and enhance its implementation. These comments discuss the Draft Framework
       section-by-section, addressing issues in the order in which they appear.

       I.        “Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs . . . .”

             With regard to Section I of the Draft Framework, the BNEJ’s comments focus primarily
       on EPA’s stated goal of “[f]inaliz[ing] guidance on considering environmental justice in




       EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       29
 rulemaking.” The BNEJ shares EPA’s goal of taking EJ issues into account when analyzing
potential regulatory actions.

        However, BNEJ believes that the specific “guidance” document that EPA is referring to
here – the May 2013 Draft Technical Guidance for Assessing Environmental Justice in
Regulatory Analysis (the “Draft EJTG”) – is not yet ready for issuance in final form. In fact, the
Draft EJTG is unlikely to help achieve EPA’s goal.

       A similar conclusion on the Draft EJTG was made by the Science Advisory Board (SAB)
panel charged with reviewing the document. On April 30, the SAB review panel released its own
lengthy and detailed critique of the Draft EJTG, urging a major overhaul and extensive rewriting.
That review is available online.1

        In recommending EPA rewrite the Draft EJTG, SAB made the following comment:

        The SAB recommends that further guidance be included in the Draft EJTG to assist
        analysts with understanding how to conduct an EJ analysis. By doing so, the SAB does
        not mean to make the Draft EJTG an all-encompassing document; rather by limiting its
        scope and not repeating existing guidance, the Draft EJTG can reduce redundancy and
        the risk of providing conflicting instructions. To increase the guidance document’s clarity,
        the Draft EJTG needs to include better definitions for the terms that are used (e.g.,
        cumulative risk, co-factors, susceptibility, vulnerability, EJ populations and communities).
        In addition, the SAB strongly recommends the use of detailed examples to guide the
        analyst through conducting the EJ analysis for regulatory action. The Draft EJTG should
        provide specific, clear options and examples of best practices for consideration by
        analysts. The Draft EJTG should emphasize the role of the analyst while devoting only a
        minimum amount of text to explaining the role of the decision/policy-makers in the same
        context. The SAB also notes that guidance for EJ methodologies should encourage the
        use of state, local, and community level data and assistance that are essential for an
        accurate national EJ analysis.

      Without repeating each of the issues raised by the SAB review panel, the section below
summarizes what the BNEJ views as the four major recommendations that should be
addressed prior to “finalizing” the Draft EJTG:

    1. The final EJTG should acknowledge the protective and conservative regulatory
       framework that is already in place. The Draft EJTG does not adequately account for
       EPA’s work and regulations issued over the last 40 years. Specifically, most of the risks
       being addressed have already been the subject of EPA regulation for several decades.
       Most of those regulations were established based on conservative assumptions and
       safety factors. Thus, these prior EPA rules were designed to protect not only typical
       individuals, but also sensitive sub-groups within the larger populations. EJ analysts will
       need to evaluate whether modifications are warranted to an existing EPA regulatory
       framework that is already highly protective. The Draft EJTG does not recognize this key
       fact.

    2. The final EJTG should be clear regarding what EJ requires in the context of
       environmental benefits. The Draft EJTG asserts that EJ must consider “not only the

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              30
          distribution of burdens across all populations, but also the distribution of reductions in
         risk from EPA actions.” But the Draft EJTG does not explain what “distribution” of risk
         reduction EJ actually requires. It seems reasonable to expect that the benefits of
         regulatory action will accrue primarily to the same persons – whatever their
         demographics might be – who are currently most affected by the environmental
         hazard(s) that EPA is reducing. Because the Draft EJTG provides no clear statement of
         the EJ goal in the context of environmental benefits, it will be very difficult for EJ analysts
         to provide useful information to EPA program officers and decision makers.

      3. The final EJTG should tailor the EJ analysis to the scope of the EJ issue. The Draft
         EJTG calls for a “blue sky” EJ analysis that incorporates many new and different factors
         and mechanisms, but it provides no benchmarks, prioritization or indication of the
         relative importance of any of them. The Draft EJTG lacks proportionality between the
         scope of the potential EJ issue that might arise in a particular context and the scope of
         the analysis of that potential EJ issue. Instead, every potential EJ issue gets the “full
         treatment.” In practical terms, this means that virtually any proposed EPA regulatory
         action could be stymied for years because the EJ analysis is deemed incomplete. It also
         means that there will be little or no consistency from one regulatory analysis to the next,
         because the list of factors is virtually endless and the range of parameters for each of
         them is unlimited. This level of uncertainty will also deprive the regulated community of
         the predictability it needs in order to plan its compliance activities and expenditures.

      4. The final EJTG should address how the impracticably large workload burdens it creates
         will be shouldered. The Draft EJTG calls for in-depth analysis of all future regulatory
         actions using innovative tools and methods. The Draft EJTG is silent as to who would
         perform all this work. It may be that the individual EPA program offices would each
         conduct these EJ analyses for their own rules. If so, the BNEJ is concerned that there
         would be a lack of consistency in final results, as each program office could interpret the
         EJTG differently. Or it may be that the work would be handled by separate staff within
         the Office of Environmental Justice (“OEJ”). If so, it is unclear as to how OEJ would
         become familiar with the extensive rulemaking records, compiled over many years, that
         typically underlie EPA’s existing regulatory framework.

         Because of the BNEJ’s deep concern over the Draft EJTG, the BNEJ filed extensive
written comments with EPA in the summer of 2013. The BNEJ also presented oral testimony
before the SAB review panel on January 30, 2014. Although the BNEJ has not received a
response from the EPA on the technical and policy points raised, it is still anticipate that it would
take EPA at least another 18 months – until late-2016 – to address all the shortcomings in the
Draft EJTG before issuing it in final form. Issuance of an incomplete or flawed document would
fail to achieve the objectives of EJ.

II.      “Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened communities.”

        With regard to Section II of the Draft Framework, the BNEJ offers two comments. First,
equal enforcement of environmental laws is an important and highly visible indicator of a
commitment to environmental justice. Regulations and permits are only as good as the public’s
level of confidence that they will be complied with and requirements will be met. The
enforcement and compliance assurance measures that EPA describes in the Draft Framework
help to underscore that commitment by confirming that industrial, commercial, and
governmental facilities are complying with the law, including the terms and conditions of their
environmental permits.



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                               31
        Secondly, EPA sometimes makes its own job more difficult by focusing heavily on
disparate impacts. This may not be the most useful approach, because the law requires equal
treatment, not equal results. BNEJ emphatically supports the proposition that environmental
standard-setting, environmental permitting, and environmental enforcement should be neutral
and non-discriminatory.

III.    “Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities.”

        The BNEJ shares this goal as stated by EPA. One specific item listed under this heading
is: “develop indicators of progress through collaborative processes with communities, states,
tribes, and other stakeholder partners.” The BNEJ urges EPA to include business and industry
among the “other stakeholder partners” with whom it will seek to develop indicators of progress.
Agreement on what constitutes progress helps foster agreement over what steps should be
taken, and when. If EPA follows an open and collaborative process in developing these
indicators, then we can look forward to successful outcomes from the perspective of all
stakeholders.

IV.     “Related efforts.”

        One of the two items listed as a “related effort” would actually benefit from greater
transparency and outreach. The entry states: “EPA will advance its program relative to the
implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act through a comprehensive, long-term Office of
Civil Rights (OCR) strategic plan, which OCR is currently developing.”

        Over the past 15 years, a significant obstacle to progress in the realm of EJ has been
EPA’s overreaching interpretation of Title VI. A good example of this problem is the highly
controversial draft guidance regarding OCR’s investigation of Title VI complaints, 65 Fed. Reg.
39,650 (June 27, 2000), which Congress eventually de-funded. See Departments of Veterans
Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act,
1999, Pub. L. No. 105-276 (1998) and Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban
Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-74 (1999).

        More fundamentally, even though the Supreme Court squarely ruled in Alexander v.
Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), that Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimination, EPA
continues to administer Title VI as if it also prohibits disparate impacts in programs run by
federal funding recipients. See 40 C.F.R. § 7.35(b) (2013). This legal overreach continues to
create uncertainty for all stakeholders and needless confrontation often results.

        Given this background, EPA should specify what it means by its “program relative to the
implementation of Title VI.” This Title VI “program” should take account of the Supreme Court’s
ruling, and focus appropriately on intentional discrimination. EPA should not continue to assert
authority over disparate impacts in environmental programs run by state agencies that receive
federal funds.

        EPA also refers to a “comprehensive, long-term” plan being devised by OCR. No
mention of that plan appears on OCR’s web site. EPA should solicit input before the OCR plan
is developed and finalized. The BNEJ strongly urges OCR to seek public and stakeholder input
on its planning, especially as it relates to the important goal of environmental justice.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           32
 V.      Priorities for 2015

         Without repeating the points made above in Part I of these comments, the BNEJ is very
concerned to see “finaliz[ing]” the Draft EJTG listed as a priority for 2015. Given the many
corrections needed to the draft document, and the comprehensive critique issued in April by the
SAB review panel, the BNEJ urges EPA to take time to address these issues rather than
prioritize finalizing the document this calendar year. Although EPA may wish to treat this
guidance document as a priority, it would be more productive to issue it in mid- or late 2016, by
which time EPA will have had more time to address the various concerns identified with that
document.

Conclusion

       Overall, the BNEJ finds the Draft Framework to be a useful exercise in priority-setting.
The BNEJ has suggested several ways in which EPA can strengthen the Draft Framework and
enhance its implementation. The BNEJ appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments
on the Draft Framework.

How, specifically, do you define an “overburdened community”? What burden(s) is/are the community bearing? Are
you using the word community in the geographic sense, social sense or both? For example air pollution doesn’t stay in
one place, so are all communities that are located downwind (as the wind typically blows) considered
“overburdened”? Are “overburdened communities” those that have higher contamination than other communities? Are
“overburdened communities” those that have higher reported instances of negative health consequences? Both? Some
other criteria? Top X% of all the communities displaying that particular criteria nationwide or within a particular EPA
region, or any and all communities that meet particular threshold criteria? Is it possible to apply to have a community
designated as an “overburdened community” so that it might receive assistance from the EPA? Based on what was
available in the draft framework it is very unclear as to what an “overburdened community” is and thus who will be the
beneficiaries of this initiative.

The outcomes seem superficial. Writing reports, networking with other government agencies and stakeholder groups,
creating reporting and decision‐making tools don’t necessarily remove the burden of the environmental injustice. This
statement “Promote holistic strategies that meet communities where they are and help them to achieve health,
sustainability, economic opportunity, revitalization and resilience” is a prime example of meaningless babble. It doesn’t
provide enough detail that someone could measure success. Be more specific about what exactly success will look like—
it should be measurable.

For example this statement:
Foster multi‐stakeholder, community‐based, public‐private partnerships (including local government, business and
industry, academia, faith groups, youth, and others) for general and location specific engagement

What does “fostering” look like? Hosting a single meeting where these groups meet each other face‐to‐face? Creating a
specific project that improves environmental quality by having members of each and every one of the groups listed
above participating for a year or more? Why are those specific groups called out? Why not include non‐governmental
organizations, senior citizens, K‐12 education? Granted, you do say “other” Are the groups that are called out
considered to be “overburdened communities” and that is why they are listed?

You say complete mandatory EJ training for all employees (page 4) and indicate it is already complete. Who do you
mean when you say employee? All employees of EPA including all employees in each of the regions and offices listed on
page 5? Only employees of the Office of Environmental Justice? All federal employees? All employees of each of the
partner groups you work with on environmental justice projects?

In my opinion this draft is too big picture to be helpful. Yes it is a framework….but it needs more timbers and less open
space between the timbers.

Re: Comments
    Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, April 15, 2015

Dear Mr. Lee:

Following are our comments on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, dated April 15, 2015. We
appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Framework and extending the comment period has allowed
us to respond. In considering our response, we feel it is important you know something about the City of
Grandview, so you can understand the context of our comments.

We are a City of over 25,000 people, the boyhood home of a President of the United States, and over 100
years old. The City of Kansas City surrounds us on three sides so we are often overlooked because of this
geographic coincidence. The Mid American Region Council (MARC), the Kansas City Metropolitan Planning
Organization has identified Grandview as an Environmental Justice (EJ) community as 100 percent of our
census tracts are classified as EJ. We are also identified as a Majority‐Minority community. We are the only
community in the MARC region with both these designations.

During the recent recession Grandview, because of good financial management practices was one of the few
cities in the MARC area that did not need to lay off employees and do drastic budget cutting. Despite their
relatively low income level our Citizens have regularly approved and renewed millages for infrastructure and
parks improvements. We have been recognized many times for the work done on projects by organizations
such as the American Public Works Association and the Missouri Parks and Recreation Association

Our City’s crime rate has been steadily decreasing since 2010 and we are currently about 7.1 percent down
through April of 2015 compared with 2014.

In 1980 the City was hit with three events that proved to be nearly catastrophic; shutdown of the Richards‐
Gebaur Air Force base, opening of a new shopping center in nearby Kansas City, and two‐waying of the
frontage roads along the future I‐49 freeway, which bi‐sects our community. Together, these events, carried
out by parties outside the control of the City, resulted in a tax base stagnant for nearly 35‐years, loss of a
significant portion of our population, and devastation of local businesses and retailers. As a result, in 2008,
FORBES magazine declared us as one of the top‐ten, fastest dying communities in the United States.

Fortunately, the last 5 years have seen the beginning of a turnaround for Grandview. We recently started
renovating Truman’s Corners, our main shopping center, originally built 60‐years ago by President Harry S.
Truman. Grandview Plaza, the City’s other major 50’s style retail complex has undergone a seven‐million
dollar renovation. After being nearly abandoned, it is now home to a private, religious based educational
facility with nearly 1,000 students. Construction is currently underway in our City on a NOAA (National

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) office/repair complex next to the NNSA (National Nuclear Security
Administration) facility built in Kansas City recently. The future also looks brighter as this spring an
announcement was made by developers of a new soccer/sports complex to be developed in Grandview,
which includes 15 soccer fields as well as retail and hotel components.

For the past several years Grandview’s population has been growing at the fastest percentage rate of any
community in the MARC region and recently climbed over the 25,000 mark for the first time in 30‐years. Our
local schools have improved significantly and have been some of the fastest growing (student population‐
wise) in the region.

Through the City’s and our citizen’s efforts we have rejuvenated our downtown – Main Street corridor, and
gained funds to dismantle the one‐way frontage road system that has hampered our redevelopment efforts
and nearly destroyed our retail base for the past 30‐years. Citizen approved millages have resulted in the
renovation of all our parks and construction of a new amphitheatre and a new water park. Yet despite these
efforts we find we are off the radar as far as EPA and its agent the Missouri Department of Natural Resources
are concerned when it comes to the health and welfare of our citizens. Similarly, we find FHWA and the
Missouri Department of Transportation continue to make significant highway modifications without even
minimal contact and coordination with the City. Our designation as an EJ community seemingly has no
meaning to these agencies when spending federal funds in our city.

As a result we have been engaged in a single‐handed legal effort to have MoDNR issue air quality permits
that comply with the current provisions of the Clean Air Act. We have been engaged in another effort to
determine how a road cutting our community in two can be designated as an Interstate route without, we
believe, any consideration or thought being given to the fact we are an EJ community and people have
trouble walking from one side of the road to the other. We have seen no EIS or environmental study even
though it is well known that air, noise, and social impacts from such facilities cause harm to EJ communities.

Having experienced, what we feel is a lack of thought or consideration about the impact of significant public
actions in our City that can negatively impact environmental health as well as its social fabric, we feel EPA’s
proposed framework should provide a basis for guiding regulators and EPA’s public agents to insure they not
only fully, but thoughtfully and meaningfully consider EJ communities in their regulatory deliberations. We
feel the Framework should insure regulators actively contact and involve EJ communities in their assessments
especially when federal dollars are involved. To this end, we have the following comments on the Draft EJ
2020 Action Agenda Framework:

     1. Above all it is important the Framework make it clear EPA and its agents must actively undertake,
        and carry out real, meaningful and sincere contacts and coordination with EJ communities. Further,
        that EJ communities of all size and make‐up be involved in regulatory actions for activities not only in
        their community, but those in nearby areas, that result in surface or groundwater run‐off, dispersion
        of air emissions, or introduce noise emissions into or over an EJ community. To this end, it should be
        clear each EJ community has a place at every regulatory worktable, and without explicit prior
        approval EPA or its agents cannot assume they speak for any EJ community.
                 While the Framework specifically calls‐out the idea of overburdened communities, the
        Framework should make it clear the term overburdened refers not only to environmental
        degradation, but to the fact that staff and resources to deal with such problems are very limited in EJ
        communities. The Framework should make it clear EPA staff understands small communities lack
        staff and resources, and most important staff that does exist is capable of understanding EJ topics.
                 The Framework should specifically define local communities as a partner to EPA in their
        regulatory work and should define a path that makes it clear to regulatory staff their partner local
        government EJ communities are not a burden on them or their work. Rather the Framework should

 Re: City of Grandview Comments
Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, April 15, 2015
July 3, 2015

          insure regulatory staffs recognize local EJ communities and their protection is in fact the entire
          objective of the EJ process and program.

     2. Section I: Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and
        environment of overburdened communities. It is critical EPA’s regulators and co‐regulators
        understand the need to seek out and make meaningful contact with EJ communities during any
        regulatory activity, and no regulatory action be taken until all affected EJ communities have been
        engaged in review and discussion. It is simply not enough EPA, its regulators and co‐regulators feel
        they know or “understand” the situation of any particular EJ community, because frankly they do
        not. Documented comments should be obtained well before any draft or final regulatory action is
        taken.
                 Our particular situation is a case in point. While we have 100 percent EJ designated census
        tracts and are a Majority‐Minority community, we are seemingly ignored time after time and our
        neighbor Kansas City, with neither a majority of its tracts classified as EJ nor a Majority‐Minority
        population, is deemed by regulatory bodies at EPA and MoDNR to speak for us.
                 The Framework must make it clear each EJ Community must have and indeed has the right
        to speak for itself, and it is essential EPA insure its regulatory staff not only not make these
        assumptions, but actively seek out comments from each EJ community that might be impacted by an
        action.
                 As it stands, in recent actions involving the implementation of federal regulatory actions
        involving Grandview, there has been no consideration given to the health and welfare of
        Grandview’s citizens. In our opinion recent actions that have been ignored have resulted in potential
        health problems related to air quality, surface water quality, and noise pollution. As a result we feel
        that the existing framework clearly is deficient in that it does not provide guidance to EPA or other
        federal staff that requires them to consider potential problems in EJ communities.

     3. Section II: Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened communities.
        We have not, and are not aware of any contacts with EPA seeking to work with us on any issues
        that might impact our Community. One reason for this may be EPA lacks knowledge of which
        communities are or have EJ designated tracts, the portion of a community that may have EJ
        designated tracts, or even which communities might have demographics that would, for example,
        cause it to be determined a Majority‐Minority community. The Framework should support the
        development of a database that would contain this information and allow regulators to identify EJ
        communities at the beginning of any regulatory action, so they could contact the community and
        thus be able to engage in meaningful dialog with them.

     4. Section III: Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities. As we
        indicated earlier, communities are different. Just because they may be adjacent to each other does
        not mean they share points of view, or have common problems. That communities are separate
        entities clearly suggests two adjacent communities should not be assumed to be able to speak for
        each other; if they could then they would probably not be separate in the first place.
                 Cities and local government communities are as different as people, so when engaging in
        regulatory actions EPA and its agents must recognize there is a difference. Grandview has,
        historically been an independent community that has taken care of itself. It seeks only the
        recognition it is a distressed community, and as an EJ community, it should be protected from
        actions that can increase existing burdens on its Citizens and most ideally, prevent any new burdens
        from being imposed.
                 Our concerns are different from, for example, the City of Kansas City Missouri’s, because we
        are smaller, we are 100 percent EJ, and we are Majority‐Minority and Kansas City is not. Our relative
        smallness means we are much closer to our citizens and businesses. Thus we are concerned with

Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, April 15, 2015
July 3, 2015

          responsiveness. Therefore we feel the Framework should emphasize that regulators also be
          responsive. In particular, in going though the regulatory process EPA regulator should not set
          deadlines for local input or responses shorter than the amount of time those same regulators have
          to respond back. That is, if EPA demands we must respond to their inquiry in 30‐days, then EPA must
          be required to respond back to us within 30‐days. The Framework, must set the standard for a fair
          and equitable discourse that respects each party’s time, and recognizes its partners in any
          determination must be treated with respect.
                   We are concerned with protecting what resources we have from deterioration, thus we
          expect the Framework direct and emphasize to regulators how they must not be dismissive of a
          community’s concerns just because they are small in area or population. As we have emphasized so
          far, the Framework must make it clear regulators actively engage in real communications with EJ
          communities of all size, and this engagement must be more than a web posting.
                    The fact is after 45‐years in government it is clear to this writer that all government
          employees are and should be busy, that is exactly what we are paid for. If employees are so “busy”
          they cannot allocate time or prioritize work to contact the very communities this Framework is
          intended to help, then they simply should be dismissed.
                   What is important to EJ communities like Grandview is that EPA actually contact us. The
          reason for this is simple. Again, after many years of local government work, it has always been made
          abundantly clear to this writer and the organizations I have represented that cities and counties
          must not contact federal agencies directly, especially when there is a state agency that has been
          delegated the regulatory authority to handle an item of interest. It has always been made
          abundantly clear attempting to go around a state regulatory agency can result in an immediate and
          long‐term regulatory disaster for a local government.
                   For an EJ community regulatory disasters are real, and simply compound (or add insult to
          injury) problems a community overburdened with environmental and related health and social
          problems already has. Again, a case in point is the quandary Grandview finds itself in when we
          question the Missouri Department of Natural Resources regarding their administration of the Clean
          Air Act. After two‐years and with no end in sight, we find we have been burdened with over
          $200,000 of legal fees because state regulators simple do not care about the health and welfare of
          an EJ community, and choose instead to protect an artificial administrative procedure. That the
          state has totally ignored the fact Grandview is an EJ community, and does in‐fact share the
          environmental burdens implicit in the EJ designation, should be of interest and concern to the EPA.
          An EJ community should not need to risk retaliation to have regulators do the right thing. Nor should
          it be necessary for an EJ community to take the extreme step of going to elected officials or EPA’s
          Inspector General to force regulators to comply with the Clean Air Act.
                   If for no other reason than wanting to make regulators actually recognize they must fully
          consider and account for EJ community concerns. EPA should want its Framework to provide
          guidance to regulators, and establish a protocol that would incorporate documentation of
          compliance.
                    In terms of outcome, EJ communities want to be able to see how EPA has actually helped
          protect EJ communities, with a count of contacts, and instances where EPA has clearly stepped in
          and caused its regulators to fully account for and deal with potential problems for our communities.
                   We expect EPA recognize the difference between an EJ community that actually has worked
          hard to pull itself up by its “bootstraps” as opposed to communities simply looking for a hand‐out or
          a way to finance unsustainable programs with other people’s money. There are not that many
          “Grandviews” around, it should be simple for EPA to keep track of and account for how their
          regulators have actually helped or worked with us to protect ourselves from the actions of others.
                   In any case, EPA’s Framework should document and account for situations where poor
          regulatory behavior has harmed an EJ community. Again, in the case of Grandview, it should not
          have cost the City over $200,000 in its quest to simply make the Missouri Department of Natural

 Re: City of Grandview Comments
Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, April 15, 2015
July 3, 2015

          Resources comply with the provisions of the Clean Air Act. EPA should be doing this fight, and the
          Framework should provide guidance so it does, and then reports its actions in a clear, concise and
          transparent way.

     5. Section IV: Related efforts.
        Promoting climate adaptation and resilience and greenhouse gas reduction co‐benefits will be an
        important part of the EJ 2020 Action Agenda: Over the past several years EPA/State regulators
        charged with enforcing the Clean Air Act have dismissed local concerns by a simple finding a
        proposed action was de minimis in nature. While there are times when such a finding may be
        proper, especially in areas away from population centers, and involving temporary, low‐source
        emitters, we strongly recommend the Framework make it clear that as far as EJ communities are
        concerned, a simple de minimis declaration by a regulatory body is never right or correct.
                 As an alternative, in the case where a meaningful dialog with the local EJ community is
        entered into, a joint declaration of a de minimis action agreed to by both the EJ community and the
        designated regulatory agency might be acceptable. In any case, use of terms such as “de minimis” by
        regulators in a dismissive way should be strongly discouraged by the Framework.
                 While a primary focus of the Administration in greenhouse gas reduction efforts has been
        the use of coal in large stationary emitters, we are concerned several small (otherwise known as de
        minimis) emitters can cumulatively add up to high‐levels of emissions. Again a case in point is in our
        City. We question how it is ever appropriate in an EJ community to have an action deemed to be de
        minimis. More to the point we cannot understand when, there is a network of air monitors in place,
        and a nearby monitor clearly shows there are high levels of regulated pollutants, and the prevailing
        winds are into an EJ community, and a new, smaller emitter is proposed to be placed in the path of
        this flow of air, a declaration an action is de minimis can result. The Framework should be such that
        regulators cannot engage in or use such bad science, especially when it involves the interests and
        especially the health of an EJ community.
                 An effective Framework invokes a change in mindset that includes regulators understanding
        what the actual purpose of a regulation is. For example, on one hand the Clean Air Act is intended to
        protect the environment, but most important it is intended to protect living beings, now and in the
        future. The Framework should insure there is enough guidance for regulators so they understand
        their job is to protect all people and be especially careful to protect those least able to protect
        themselves.

          EPA will advance its program relative to the implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act through
          a comprehensive, long‐term Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Strategic Plan, which OCR is currently
          developing: It is important, we feel, when organizations such as EPA or FHWA do work that impacts
          a community like as ours, and especially when that work involves federal funds, that communities be
          fully engaged in developing those projects. More importantly, this engagement must be positive and
          take the form of a true two‐way dialog. While distressed communities often have difficulty
          maintaining large staffs that can engage in pro‐active activities, we do have staffs capable of
          engaging and contributing to meaningful dialogs relating to a wide range of technical and social
          matters.
                    However, because of the general lack of staff, we need to know EPA regulators will seek to
          contact us, or at a minimum provide a “heads‐up” before any regulatory or design action affecting
          our community takes place. Again, if projects using federal funds are affecting our community, then
          user agencies and regulators must be required to contact communities like ours and engage in
          meaningful dialog, and if they do not then they must be considered to not be in compliance with
          Title VI.
                    The Framework should stress the use of federal funds be interpreted very broadly. For
          example if a facility, in the course of manufacturing a construction material creates emissions

Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, April 15, 2015
July 3, 2015

          exceeding limits imposed by the Clean Air Act, then the use of that material on any federally funded
          project should be prohibited. Again, if in the course of creating such materials, the excess emissions
          enter or involve an EJ community, then the facility should be considered to not be in compliance.

In closing, we feel it is important to emphasize we feel the EPA Framework can be a positive mechanism to
insure EJ communities are protected from further damage. However, it has not been our experience any
group or organization, including the EPA and its regulatory agents, cares or even understands what being an
EJ community really means. If fact we see it is a designation that is often ignored and our concerns are
ridiculed and demeaned.

The EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework can provide positive guidance to regulators and other government
officials, but there must be a significant shift in how regulators view EJ communities. Even more important,
regulators must see and understand who and where EJ communities are.

Re: Public Comments on EJ 2020 Strategic Plan on Environmental Justice and Health; Ensure
Compliance with Title VI and Executive Order 12898; Address Parks as an Environmental Justice,
Health, and Civil Rights Concern; Pope Francis the Poor and the Earth Are Crying

I. Overview

We submit these comments as part of a diverse and growing alliance regarding the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s proposed strategic plan on environmental justice and health, which will be called EJ
2020. The stated goals of EJ 2020 are to:

     •    Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and
          environment of overburdened communities;
     •    Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within communities; and
     •    Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to communities.

We submit these comments to highlight leadership and best practice examples to ensure compliance with
civil rights, and environmental justice and health, laws and principles. These laws and principles include
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations, and the President’s Executive
Order 12898 on environmental justice and health. These laws and principles apply to EPA, and to
recipients of funding from EPA.1 We request that EPA implement Title VI, the Title VI
implementing regulations, and Executive Order 12898 in EPA’s own work, and in ensuring
compliance with these laws by recipients of funding from EPA.

Title VI and its regulations prohibit intentional discrimination, as well as unjustified discriminatory
impacts, on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs and activities by recipients of federal
funding. Title VI and its regulations covers recipients of funding from EPA, including state and local
agencies and private recipients.2 The discriminatory impact standard plays an important role in
uncovering discriminatory intent: it counteracts disguised animus, unconscious prejudices, and implicit
bias that escape easy classification as intentional discrimination. See Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, 576 U. S. – (2015) (upholding discriminatory
impact standard under the Fair Housing Act). Executive Order 12898 requires each federal agency
including EPA to achieve environmental justice as part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs,
policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.3 We request that EPA

 provide leadership and best practices and integrate its enforcement responsibilities under Title VI
and its implementing regulations, Executive Order 12898, and EPA’s other environmental justice
and health strategies throughout all its programs and activities, including EJ 2020.

In Pope Francis’s encyclical on caring about our common home, the Pope counsels us to care about
climate, care for creation, and care for the poor and underprivileged. EPA’s work and EJ 2020 should
reflect the Pope’s encyclical. Indeed, Administrator McCarthy recognizes that climate justice is not just
an environmental issue, but a public health threat, and a chance for economic opportunity. ""I think the
most important thing that we can do, working with the Pope, is to try to remind ourselves that this is
really about protecting natural resources that human beings rely on, and that those folks that are most
vulnerable — that the church has always been focused on, those in poverty and low income — are the
first that are going to be hit and impacted by a changing climate.""4

These comments focus on access to parks and green space for people of color and low income people for
several reasons. First, President Barack Obama and other federal authorities – as well as Pope Francis –
recognize parks and green space as issues of social justice, and environmental justice and health. Second,
federal authorities provide EPA with leadership and best practice examples for addressing parks and
green space under civil rights, and environmental justice and health, laws and principles. Third, EPA
itself must address access to parks and green space as an environmental, health, and justice issue. Instead,
EPA generally marginalizes or ignores these concerns. Finally, the examples below are not limited to the
context of parks and green space. The legal framework and best practices cut across other environmental
programs and activities.5

According to President Barack Obama:

         We heard from the community . . . . Too many children . . . especially children of color, don’t
         have access to parks where they can run free, breathe fresh air, experience nature and learn about
         their environment. This is an issue of social justice. . . . Because it’s not enough to have this
         awesome natural wonder within your sight – you have to be able to access it. My commitment to
         conservation isn’t about locking away our natural treasures; it’s about working with communities
         to open up our glorious heritage to everybody — young and old, black, white, Latino, Asian,
         Native American — to make sure everybody can experience these incredible gifts.6

Mountains National Monument in 2014, his remarks are true in communities of color and low income

 communities across the nation that suffer from disparities in access to resources for parks and healthy
living.7

We do not seek Blue parks, or Red parks, based on ideology or party affiliations. We seek green parks for
all.

II. The Values at Stake

The diverse values at stake in access to parks and green space are properly the concern of EPA.
According to the National Park Service (NPS), these values include the following:

    •    Fun, health, and human development: Children who are physically fit tend to do better
         academically, and parks can create community and drive out vandalism and crime.
    •    Conservation values: This includes climate justice, complete green streets with transit, biking,
         hiking, and safe routes to schools, clean air, water, and land, and habitat protection.
    •    Economic values: This includes jobs and apprenticeships for youth, diversification of government
         contracts to include small, minority, women, and veteran owned enterprises and people of color
         NGOs, and avoiding gentrification and displacement as communities become greener, more
         expensive, and more desirable.
    •    Art, culture, and spiritual values. This includes the Pope’s encyclical on caring about our
         common home. This also includes Native American values.
    •    Equal justice, democracy, and livability for all. “Ultimately, we can appeal to the values that we
         strive to achieve as a community and democracy and emphasize the inherent democratic nature
         of public spaces.”8

Human health includes a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely
alleviating chronic diseases including obesity and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization
and NPS.9

III. Best Practice Framework for EPA to Ensure Compliance with Civil Rights, and Environmental
Justice and Health, Laws and Principles

In addition to President Obama, the following federal authorities provide leadership and best practice
examples for EPA to implement compliance with civil rights, and environmental justice and health, laws
and principles. These examples include National Park Service, US Army Corps of Engineers, US
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Under Secretary of Agriculture Robert Bonnie,
Representative Judy Chu, and Representative Raúl Grijalva, who is the Ranking Member of the U.S.
House Committee on Natural Resources.

 NPS and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) agree on the framework for environmental justice
and health to address parks and healthy active living. According to the NPS draft study to expand the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (“Rim of the Valley” or ROTV),10 the NPS draft
study for the San Gabriel Mountains National Recreation Area,11 and the USACE draft study to restore
the Los Angeles River:12

         (1) There are disparities in park and green access based on race, color, or national origin;
         (2) This contributes to health disparities based on those factors; and
         (3) Environmental justice laws and principles require agencies to address these disparities.

Attached are maps on green access and health, and the relevant, highlighted portions of the three NPS and
USACE studies.

Robert Bonnie, who is the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at the US Department
of Agriculture, agrees. Under Secretary Bonnie provides leadership and commitment on environmental
justice and health on behalf of the United State Forest Service when he writes as follows regarding the
proposed management plan for the San Gabriel Mountains:

         Environmental justice is a very important issue for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
         and the US Forest Service. Executive Order 12898 requires each Federal agency to address
         environmental justice as part of its mission. Pursuant to this Executive Order, USDA has an
         Environmental Justice Strategic Plan which was updated in 2012 and signed by Secretary
         Vilsack. . . . In keeping with this direction from the strategic plan as well as the requirements for
         stakeholder input in the 2012 Forest Service planning rule, the Forest Service will pursue an
         inclusive, open and transparent process in developing the San Gabriel Mountains National
         Monument plan that will meet with the requirements of the Executive Order as well as USDA’s
         environmental justice policies. Beyond that, the Forest Service is deeply committed to
         strengthening relationships with all communities and citizens. This planning process will afford
         an opportunity to build on that commitment.

Representative Raúl Grijalva and the US House Committee on Natural Resources held a forum in Los
Angeles in April 2015 attended by seven members of Congress. The forum explicitly addressed the need
to implement Title VI and Executive Order 12898 in the context of parks and green access.13

 Rep. Judy Chu spoke on environmental justice and parks at the April House forum in Los Angeles.

          Well thank you Ranking Member Grijalva and the Natural Resources Committee for holding this
          very important forum on the state of environmental justice . . . . I’d like to talk about
          environmental justice as it relates to parks. Los Angeles is one of the most park poor places in the
          country. Just 15% of the region’s population has pedestrian access to green spaces, leaving more
          than 85% of residents without easy access to public parks or green spaces, particularly affecting
          minorities and those from low-income communities. And there’s a color divide. Did you know
          that in L.A., white neighborhoods enjoy 32 acres of parks per 1,000 people, but for African
          American neighborhoods it’s 1.7, and for Latino neighborhoods it’s .6.

The transcript and video of these remarks are available on The City Project blog.14 Representative Judy
Chu also cites environmental justice and health as two of the main justifications for her proposed
legislation to create the San Gabriel Mountains National Recreation Area.15

Andrew Cuomo, who was then the Secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development,
provides a best practice to address the values at stake under Title VI and Executive Order 12898.
Secretary Cuomo withheld federal subsidies for proposed warehouses at what is now Los Angeles State
Historic Park unless there was a full environmental review that considered the park alternative and the
impact on people of color and low-income people. Secretary Cuomo cited Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and the President’s Executive Order 12898 on environmental justice and health. Secretary Cuomo
acted in response to an administrative complaint based on these civil rights and other housing laws filed
by diverse community allies, including The City Project. Secretary Cuomo’s leadership and actions, and
this community victory, are a seminal moment for people, planning, and parks in the green justice
movement.16 They provide best practices for EPA to conduct compliance analyses under Title VI and
12898.

The following planning process applies to federal agencies, and to recipients of federal funding including
state and local agencies and private recipients, to help ensure compliance and equity under Title VI and
Executive Order 12898.

     1. Describe what you plan to do – for example, revitalize the Los Angeles River.
     2. Analyze the benefits and burdens on all people, including people of color and low-income people.
     Who benefits, and who gets left behind? Analyze the values at stake. The analysis should address any
     numerical disparities, statistical studies, and anecdotal evidence; impacts based on race, color or
     national origin; inequalities based on income and wealth; and the use of GIS mapping and census data.
     Follow the money.
     3. Include people of color and low-income people in the decision making process.
     4. Analyze the alternatives.
     5. Develop an implementation and monitoring plan to distribute benefits and burdens fairly, avoid
     unjustified discriminatory impacts and intentional discrimination, and comply with civil rights,
     environmental justice and health, and environmental laws and principles.17

 EPA can implement compliance with Title VI and 12898 through various means. This includes planning,
regulations, data collection and analyses, review of federal funding applications, contractual assurances of
compliance by recipients of federal financial assistance, compulsory self-evaluations by recipients,
compliance reviews after funding, investigation of administrative complaints, full and fair public
participation in the compliance and enforcement process, and termination and deferral of funding. The
Department of Justice has civil rights coordinating responsibility with federal agencies and can enforce
civil rights laws in court.18

IV. EPA Must Recognize that Access to Parks and Healthy Green Space Is a Civil Rights and
Environmental Justice Issue

EPA must recognize that access to parks and healthy green space is a civil rights and environmental
justice issue. Among other things, this entails that EPA revise its environmental justice mapping and
screening tool called EJScreen to include parks and green space.19

EPA needs to include park and green space data in its EJ Screen in part so that public officials can
develop standards to measure compliance, equity, and progress, and to hold public officials accountable.
Park funds in California have been prioritized based on need in communities that are defined under state
law as “park poor” and “income poor.” Park poor is defined as less than three acres of parks per thousand
residents, and income poor is below $48,706 in median household income. These communities are
disproportionately of color. The park poor, income poor standards are a best practice to define standards
to promote compliance, measure equity and progress, and hold public officials accountable.20

The attached two maps of California illustrate that the same communities that are disproportionately of
color and low income are also the most burdened for pollution, and are the most vulnerable to its effects.
The same communities also have the worst access to green space.

table comparing 12898 and Title VI is also attached below.
   California and other states provide similar protections. California Attorney General Kamala Harris, for example, has published
a fact sheet on civil rights and environmental justice protections under California law for projects that are funded or administered
by the state. The Attorney General’s fact statement is available on the web at

 The same communities that are disproportionately of color and low income are also the most burdened for
pollution, and are the most vulnerable to its effects. Thus:

    •   In the communities that are the most burdened for pollution and vulnerability (the 10 percent
        worst score under California’s CalEnviroScreen (CES), fully 89 percent of the people are of color
        and only 11 percent are non-Hispanic white people. Statewide, the population average is 58
        percent people of color.
    •   In the communities that are the least burdened for pollution and vulnerability (the 10 percent best
        CES scores), only 31 percent of the people are of color and fully 69 percent are non-Hispanic
        white people.
    •   Sixty-four percent of people of color live in the most-burdened communities for pollution and
        vulnerability (the 50 percent worst CES scores) — only 31 percent of non-Hispanic white people
        live in those areas.
    •   Only 36 percent of people of color live in the least-burdened communities for pollution and
        vulnerability (the 50 percent best CES scores) and fully 69 percent of non-Hispanic white people
        live in those areas.

The measures of pollution and vulnerability are from CES. The City Project and GreenInfo Network
provide the analysis on race, color, national origin, and green access, because CES inappropriately
excludes these factors. EPA should require California to include race, color, and national origin in CES in
order to facilitate compliance with Title VI and its regulations.

 V. Reflect in EPA’s Work including EJ 2020 Pope Francis’s Encyclical on Caring about Climate,
Caring for Creation, and Caring for the Poor and Disadvantaged

Pope Francis in his encyclical on caring for our common home calls for all of humanity to care about
climate, care about creation, and care about the poor and underprivileged. The Pope intricately weaves
moral and spiritual teachings with science, economics, and politics, addressing environmental values as
well as human dignity and human rights. See Pope Francis, Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ of the Holy
Father Francis on Care for our Common Home.21 We request that EPA reflect the Pope’s encyclical in its
work including EJ 2020.

A. Park Access and the Disposable of Society

Pope Francis, President Barack Obama, USFS, NPS, and HUD emphasize similar values in park access.

Pope Francis writes that we find beautiful green space in safe areas, but not where the disposable of
society live. This is true in communities of color and low income communities across the nation, as
discussed above. This can lead to brutality and exploitation. The Pope emphasizes the need to include
those who are most affected in the planning process. Thus the Pope writes:

     Many cities are huge, inefficient structures, excessively wasteful of energy and water.
     Neighborhoods, even those recently built, are congested, chaotic and lacking in sufficient green
     space. We were not meant to be inundated by cement, asphalt, glass and metal, and deprived of
     physical contact with nature.

     In some places, rural and urban alike, the privatization of certain spaces has restricted people’s access
     to places of particular beauty. In others, “ecological” neighborhoods have been created which are
     closed to outsiders in order to ensure an artificial tranquility. Frequently, we find beautiful and
     carefully manicured green spaces in so-called “safer” areas of cities, but not in the more hidden areas
     where the disposable of society live.

     The extreme poverty experienced in areas lacking harmony, open spaces or potential for integration,
     can lead to incidents of brutality and to exploitation . . . . Here too, we see how important it is that
     urban planning always take into consideration the views of those who will live in these areas.

     There is . . . a need to protect those common areas, visual landmarks and urban landscapes which
     increase our sense of belonging, of rootedness, of “feeling at home” within a city which includes us
     and brings us together. It is important that the different parts of a city be well integrated and that those
     who live there have a sense of the whole, rather than being confined to one neighborhood and failing

21
  See The City Project’s blog posts on Pope Francis’s encyclical: Pope Francis Care about Climate Justice, Care for Creation,
Care for the Poor Encyclical in English, Español, etc. (www.cityprojectca.org/blog/archives/38050); Pope Francis “The poor
and the earth are crying out.” Who are the poor in the US and CA? (www.cityprojectca.org/blog/archives/38317); Pope Francis

Prof. Michael Gerrard writes: “The remarkable Encyclical Letter issued last week by Pope Francis could be read as a primer on
the importance and idealized operation of many of our environmental laws.” Prof. Gerrard identifies as examples the National
Environmental Protection Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and Endangered Species Act. Prof.
Gerrard also cites the Encyclical’s discussion of Zoning, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Yet-to-be written
laws on energy transition, and the Importance of Environmental Laws. See Pope Francis on Environmental Law, available at

     to see the larger city as space which they share with others. For this same reason, in both urban and
    rural settings, it is helpful to set aside some places which can be preserved and protected from
    constant changes brought by human intervention.

    Anyone who grew up in the hills, or sat by the spring to drink as a child, or played outdoors in the
    neighborhood park, feels one is being called to recover one’s true self when one goes back to those
    places.

Encyclical, ¶¶ 44-45, 84, 149-51.

B. Climate Justice

Pope Francis recognizes that climate justice and environmental degradation cannot be solved without
solving the problems of poverty and inequality. Thus the Pope writes:

        Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic,
        political and for the distribution of goods. . . . Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing
        countries in coming decades. Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena
        related to warming . . . . ¶ 25.

        We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with
        one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an
        integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time
        protecting nature. ¶ 131.

We agree. Climate worsens a range of health problems, especially for communities of color and low
income communities. Latinos and other people of color disproportionately believe climate science, and
are willing to support climate action. Responding to the climate challenge can create jobs, improve
people’s health, reduce heating and cooling bills, and reduce the damage caused by the production of
fossil fuels. We can grow the economy and promote human health, the environment, and equal justice at
the same time. See Robert García and Ariel Collins, Climate is a civil rights and moral issue as well as a
health, economic, and environmental issue (2015), www.cityprojectca.org/blog/archives/35499.

C. Environmental, Equity, and Health Impact Assessments

The assessment the Pope describes is consistent with a compliance and equity assessment under civil
rights laws, including Title VI and Executive Order 12898. Health impact assessments are consistent with
both the Pope’s and the civil rights assessments.

The Pope writes: “In any discussion about a proposed venture, a number of questions need to be asked in
order to discern whether or not it will contribute to genuine integral development. What will it
accomplish? Why? Where? When? How? For whom? What are the risks? What are the costs?
Who will pay those costs and how?” Thus the purpose of an environmental impact assessment includes
equity and health:

       Environmental impact assessment should not come after the drawing up of a business proposition
       or the proposal of a particular policy, plan or programme. It should be part of the process from the
       beginning, and be carried out in a way which is interdisciplinary, transparent and free of all
       economic or political pressure. It should be linked to a study of working conditions and possible
       effects on people’s physical and mental health, on the local economy and on public safety.


                                                     11
EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                      55
         Economic returns can thus be forecast more realistically, taking into account potential scenarios
        and the eventual need for further investment to correct possible undesired effects. A consensus
        should always be reached between the different stakeholders, who can offer a variety of
        approaches, solutions and alternatives. The local population should have a special place at the
        table; they are concerned about their own future and that of their children, and can consider goals
        transcending immediate economic interest. . . . The participation of the latter also entails being
        fully informed about such projects and their different risks and possibilities; this includes not just
        preliminary decisions but also various follow-up activities and continued monitoring. Honesty and
        truth are needed in scientific and political discussions; these should not be limited to the issue of
        whether or not a particular project is permitted by law.

        In the face of possible risks to the environment which may affect the common good now and in the
        future, decisions must be made “based on a comparison of the risks and benefits foreseen for the
        various possible alternatives”. This is especially the case when a project may lead to a greater use
        of natural resources, higher levels of emission or discharge, an increase of refuse, or significant
        changes to the landscape, the habitats of protected species or public spaces. Some projects, if
        insufficiently studied, can profoundly affect the quality of life of an area due to very different
        factors such as unforeseen noise pollution, the shrinking of visual horizons, the loss of cultural
        values, or the effects of nuclear energy use. The culture of consumerism, which prioritizes short-
        term gain and private interest, can make it easy to rubber-stamp authorizations or to conceal
        information. ¶¶ 183-85 (citations omitted).

VI. Diversity, Funding and Compliance

Transformational change is necessary to attain the world we seek and to modernize the environmental,
climate, and health movement. Diversifying the boards and staff of white mainstream NGOs is only part
of the solution. EPA and other agencies, mainstream environmental organizations, and foundations need
to fund diverse organizations whose core values are to serve communities of color and low income
communities, including grass roots, environmental justice, and civil rights organizations. EPA and other
agencies, organizations, and foundations need to ensure compliance with civil rights and environmental
justice laws in principles.22

VII. EPA Must Create a Culture of Compliance with Civil Rights, and Environmental Justice and
Health, Laws and Principles

EPA must create a culture of leadership and best practices for compliance with Title VI and Executive
Order 12898, following the examples cited above and going beyond them.

There is instead a culture at EPA that marginalizes and ignores compliance with the law, including Title
VI and Executive Order 12898. This culture of non-compliance is manifested in a range of ways. EPA has
a “record of poor performance” on civil rights.23 EPA commonly uses euphemisms to avoid controlling
legal standards. Thus, for example, EPA states that it seeks to make “a visible difference in
environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically-distressed communities.”24 While people

 of color and low income people are commonly “overburdened, underserved, and economically-
distressed,” the legal standards are written in the stated legal terms, not in the latter amorphous terms.
EPA must enforce the laws.

That is why we submit the present comments. “[L]lack of respect for the law is becoming more common.
Laws may be well framed yet remain a dead letter. . . . Because the enforcement of laws is at times
inadequate . . . , public pressure has to be exerted in order to bring about decisive political action. Society,
through non-governmental organizations and intermediate groups, must put pressure on governments to
develop more rigorous regulations, procedures and controls. Unless citizens control political power –
national, regional and municipal – it will not be possible to control damage to the environment.”
Encyclical ¶ 179.

Conclusion

We look forward to working with EPA to ensure compliance with civil rights, and environmental justice
and health, laws and principles, now and through EJ 2020.

to comment on EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, which was released to the
public on April 15, 2015. CEEC is encouraged by EPA’s commitment to making a visible
difference in communities across America, including, without limitation, those that are
environmentally overburdened, underserved or economically distressed. CEEC also appreciates
the many long-standing policies and commitments EPA has made to advance the meaningful
consideration of environmental justice (EJ) factors in the Agency’s decision-making. CEEC
recognizes that the Framework marks the beginning of an ambitious new environmental justice
agenda, but we are concerned that it does not provide sufficient details about the Agency’s plans
to allow for meaningful public review and comment. CEEC is also concerned that the
Framework wholly overlooks one of the core elements of EJ – disproportionate impact.

        Founded in 1995, CEEC is the only cross-industry business coalition that brings together
the diverse perspectives of legal, technical and governmental affairs professionals on
environmental health and safety issues in the context of enforcement policy and practice. For
many years, CEEC and its 29 member companies have maintained an active and constructive
dialogue with EPA on its enforcement policies and initiatives. Indeed, at our March 12, 2015
member meeting, Matt Tejada joined us to discuss EJ developments within the Agency,

including the Framework, EJSCREEN and the recently released EPA guide on incorporating EJ
into the rulemaking process. CEEC welcomed Mr. Tejada’s willingness to engage with us and
his commitment to involving business and industry in EPA’s EJ-related community outreach
efforts.

Scope of Framework

        EJ is based on two core elements: a disadvantaged community and a disproportionate
impact to that community. Noticeably absent from the Framework is any reference to, or
acknowledgement of, the second element. CEEC believes that this is a fundamental oversight
that must be corrected before the Framework is finalized. Indeed, much more needs to be done
to bring clarity to the agency’s EJ efforts in terms of what constitutes a disproportionate impact
and how such an impact is measured. CEEC is concerned that the agency sometimes focuses
only on the existence of a disadvantaged community and the fact that a facility (or facilities) may
“impact” that community, without enough attention on the issue of whether the facility/facilities
at issue have a “disproportionate” impact. Doing so could run afoul of the Agency’s long-
standing EJ policies.

         Any effort to address EJ in permitting, rulemaking or enforcement should be based on
valid, real time monitoring data that show disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects on the disadvantaged community in which a particular facility is located.
If there are such valid scientific findings based on those data, EPA’s next step must be to assess
the reasons for the disproportionate impact. CEEC notes that “reasons” for an impact are very
different than “sources” of an impact. The purpose of EPA’s assessment must be to evaluate
whether there are other “reasons” for the impact that could and should be handled using a
mechanism other than, for example, automatically targeting a particular facility with a pending
permit. CEEC believes that the assessment should include a review of whether there are other
environmental indicators, such as traffic, that are causing the impact, or other facilities that are
also impacting the community while operating completely outside of the regulatory system (e.g.,
no permits whatsoever). If either is the case, then CEEC submits it would be more appropriate,
in the first instance, to look to address whatever disproportionate impact is occurring by bringing
those facilities or activities into the regulatory system and enforcing compliance with applicable
regulatory and permitting requirements. This approach needs to be captured in the Framework.

Using EJ in Enforcement

        The Framework calls for EJ to be used for targeting, case development and resolution of
compliance and enforcement actions in overburdened communities. However, CEEC suggests
that use of EJ as a “targeting” tool (both in civil and criminal enforcement) needs to be carefully
considered to the extent it is used as a proxy for determining whether individual cases merit
enforcement. CEEC has emphasized previously that as a legal and policy matter, enforcement is
appropriately focused on non-compliance with existing legal requirements – regardless of
whether EJ is a factor or not. CEEC believes it is important that EJ not be used to redefine what
constitutes compliance or non-compliance.

        CEEC is concerned that EJ will be used to pressure regulated entities into accepting new
compliance requirements through adjudicated settlements (and permits) that have not been
established through normal APA procedures. This approach could undermine the very thing the
Agency seeks for EJ purposes, i.e., robust public engagement.

Using NextGen Tools to Further EJ Goals

         The Framework also encourages more NextGen monitoring, community-based
participatory research and citizen science. As noted in CEEC’s written comments on EPA’s
Notice and Request for Comment on Improving EPA Regulations, 80 Fed. Reg. 12,372 (March 9,
2015), CEEC supports EPA’s NextGen Compliance Initiative. We are particularly interested in
opportunities for EPA to use NextGen to shift from a retroactive compliance approach (i.e., one
that measures and enforces what went wrong) to one that is more proactive (i.e., encouraging and
rewarding programs that prevent things from going wrong in the first place). CEEC views these
opportunities as particularly valuable in the EJ context, especially as EPA seeks to foster more
local community collaborations. CEEC also believes that for NextGen to be both useful and
defensible, EPA must provide clear and objective standards for data quality, authentication and
veracity (particularly as they relate to new and emerging mobile apps that lack – and indeed may
fail – such standards). CEEC encourages EPA to address these NextGen considerations and
concerns in the final Framework.

Collaborating with EJ Partners

        Consistent with the Agency’s call for greater collaboration, CEEC encourages EPA to
identify ways to reduce environmental impacts to overburdened communities, including
improving economic opportunity and revitalization. Many cases of disparate impacts,
particularly in urban settings, are the result of many years of benign economic neglect from local
political decision-making that must be resolved over time with greater capacity building and
sustainable development. We believe this type of collaboration needs to be explicitly identified
and encouraged in the Framework.

Demonstrating Progress on EJ Outcomes

         As part of the Framework, EPA has asked for public input on whether there are particular
program areas of such consequence to overburdened communities that should be the focus of
attention nationally, including, for example, drinking water and lead paint. CEEC believes that
these are both worthy examples, and further, that any EJ priorities should coincide with the
agency’s overarching priorities for protecting the environment and public. Nothing is more
critical than safe, healthy and sustainable water resources, yet the Nation’s crumbling water
infrastructure is having enormous adverse impacts on small and rural communities – many of
them minority and poor – without the financial and technical resources to fix the problem. These
are complex issues that cannot be resolved by EJ initiatives alone, but should include Congress,
the States, mayors, businesses, industries, NGOs and community leaders, more reinvestment in
failing infrastructure, improvements in local governance, and increased enforcement against
those entities operating outside of the law.

        In closing, we want to thank you for this opportunity to provide input on the Framework.
CEEC is committed to continuing its engagement with the Agency on this important topic and
believes that the collective experience and perspective of our members would greatly improve
the direction and ultimate success of EPA’s EJ agenda.

Hello,




Below are some comments we have in regards to your EJ 2020 Action Framework.




    A great number of overburdened communities that we serve are immigrant communities, meaning that a large portion of the
population cannot speak English well or at all. I suggest providing more information in other languages or in simple English so
that people living in EJ communities can be well informed.

   We desire to see more tangible results in regards to issues in EJ communities. In our area, that includes shutting down or
reducing the emissions of the biggest polluters which contribute to Detroit having among the highest asthma rates in the country
and Detroit's 48217 being the most polluted zip code in the state of Michigan.

    Finally, we would like to see harsher consequences for polluters that violate EPA standards, especially those that pollute in
already overburdened communities.

Attached is a publication by the Sierra Club Detroit Chapter entitled The State of Detroit’s
Environment , which describes Detroit's most prevalent environmental issues and facts and figures
from recent studies. I hope that this publication and email can help you understand the urgency of
environmental justice issues in Detroit.

Thank you for your time.

Best wishes,

    TO:             Charles Lee, Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental
                    Justice, EPA Office of Environmental Justice
    FROM:           David Konisky, Georgetown University

    SUBJECT:        Comments on EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
    DATE:           May 27, 2015

    The EPA has taken important steps in recent years to better integrate environmental justice
    into its decision-making. The documents produced as part of EPA’s EJ Plan 2014 in
    particular have directed significant attention to how the agency will use regulatory
    enforcement to achieve improved outcomes in overburdened communities. And, there is
    some preliminary indication in a recent EPA Office of Inspector General report that EPA
    regional offices have begun to actively consider environmental justice in their enforcement
    programs.

    Despite these advances, we believe the EPA needs to take additional actions to ensure that
    these activities extend to state regulatory enforcement efforts. EPA’s report, “Advancing
    Environmental Justice through Compliance and Enforcement, Implementation Plan” notes
    that the EPA will work with state governments to achieve compliance and enforcement
    goals, but the steps to be taken are vague, and do not specify how the EPA will use its
    significant capacity to assure that state governments fulfill the agency’s enforcement goals
    in the federal programs they implement.

    This is an important area that we believe the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework does
    not satisfactorily address. The Environmental Council of the States has estimated that more
    than 90% of the actions taken to enforce major federal pollution control laws are carried
    out by state administrative agencies, and states have considerable discretion in determining
    their enforcement strategies. For this reason, we believe it is imperative that the EPA work
    directly with states to be sure that the EPA’s environmental justice related enforcement
    goals are carried out by state agencies.

    We have completed a number of studies (listed at the end of this memorandum) of state
    enforcement of laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act that have found significant disparities in enforcement.
    Specifically, we have consistently found that state regulators tend to direct fewer
    compliance monitoring inspections and fewer enforcement actions in response to violations
    when facilities are located in communities with large proportions of poor and minority
    communities. Moreover, our research indicates that these disparities have not diminished
    in the years since the issuance of Executive Order 12898.

    University or Florida State University.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            63
     For these reasons, we believe it is critical that the EPA broaden the Draft EJ 2020 Action
    Agenda Framework in the area of enforcement to emphasize the important role of states.
    Specifically, we strongly recommend that a fourth priority be added to the “Advance
    environmental justice through compliance and enforcement” section of the framework:
    “Work with state, tribal, local governments and other co-regulators to develop robust
    enforcement programs in overburdened communities.”

    Further, we recommend that the EPA take the following actions in support of this additional
    priority:

        •    EPA regional offices should closely oversee states' enforcement programs to be sure
             they are targeting facilities in overburdened communities.
        •    EPA should direct states to use EPA tools such as EJScreen to identify enforcement
             targets.
        •    States should regularly report to the EPA on their compliance and enforcement
             efforts in overburdened communities.
        •    EPA should monitor administrative procedures within state agencies given their
             influence over facility targeting.
        •    EPA should integrate environmental justice priorities in performance partnership
             agreements and other federal-state cooperative arrangements.

    In sum, we believe that the EPA needs to vigorously engage with state agencies and other
    relevant government authorities to assure that the compliance and enforcement initiatives
    that the agency is pursuing as part of the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework are
    effective.

        Mr. Lee,

        Thank you for the opportunity to review and provide input on U.S. Environmental Protection
        Agency's (EPA's) Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework (EJ 2020). We are pleased to leam
        that EPA remains committed to environmental justice, and that it plans to strengthen the
        foundation established by Plan EJ 2014. Below you will find our comments and questions on the
        draft framework. We look forward to informing the EJ 2020 process further if need be, and to
        continuing our collaboration with the Office of Environmental Justice.

                 We are looking forward to the National Program Managers guidance which, according to
                 the draft framework, will be developed in the next two years under EJ 2020. Under the
                  section ""Priorities in 2015,"" it reads that ""measurable activities to advance environmental
                 justice"" will be included in the National Program Managers guidance. Will the goals
                 delineated inEJ 2020 have measurements associated with them? What will be the
                 quantifiable indicators of progress for the EJ 2020 goals?

                 We believe that every plan needs to be followed up with a pulse check or progress report
                 of some kind. Does EPA intend on providing a progress report a few years after goal
                 implementation is underway?

                 It is our hope that EJ 2020, and any derivative guidance, will prioritize cross-
                 jurisdictional partnerships (i.e., partnerships between geographically adjacent local
                 governments). Environmental issues often cross boundaries and are diffuse in nature.
                 Therefore, when enacting policy, we request that future EPA directives local
                 governments should work with their neighbors that are located both upwind and
                  downwind of them.

          We're pleased to see public-private partnerships (P3) mentioned under Goal II.C of EJ
         2020. We would like to see more of an emphasis on P3 in EJ 2020 moving forward. P3 is
         an approach that has been proven to be successful in certain community revitalization
         projects (i.e., ReGenesis in South Carolina, and Prince Georges County, MD). Private
         entities are often pointed out as being the cause of environmental injustices; however,
         they can also be part of the solution if they are involved early on in the planning process.
         We hope EJ 2O2O will encourage stakeholders to leverage the strengths of P3s so that
         businesses can be brought into the fold as active stewards of social responsibility.

         Under Goal II.A, EJ 2020lists stakeholder engagement as a goal. There are two types of
         public dialogue or engagement - reactive and proactive. Reactive engagement occurs
         when communities react to environmental policy decisions after they have been made.
         Proactive engagement occurs when policy makers use public participation to inform their
         goals prior to decision-making. More often than not, reactive engagement is the
         predominant or only form of public feedback. We hope EJ 2020 encourages stakeholders
         to elevate the use of proactive civil engagement over reactive engagement.

        We recommend including green infrastructure as one of the climate justice considerations
        inEJ 2020.EJ 2020 should elevate the importance of building and maintaining reliable
        infrastructure in low-income and minority communities. This includes all types of
        infrastructure - critical infrastructure (e.g., evacuation routes for climate change-related
        disasters), urban/municipal infrastrucfure (e.g., sewer systems), and green infrastructure
        (e.g., greenroofs, rain gardens). Typically, resilient infrastructure is most lacking in
       wlnerable communities. EPA might consider including this as one of EJ 2020'sclimate
       justice goals: strengthen infrastructure programs in neighborhoods that traditionally don,t
       receive resources to do so.

       We were pleased to see an emphasis placed on the role of local government in executing
       EJ 2020. Local goverrlment should play a lead role in connecting vulnerable communities
       to available resources. The challenges that communities face are often not about resource
       scarcity, but rather about identifiiing and tapping into available resources. Often, these
       communities aren't aware of existing resources (funding, grants, green rebate programs,
       toolkits) or they don't know the right channels to access them. We hope the finalized plan
       will include this consideration.

   o Local goverlment should also play a facilitator role in helping the environmental justice
       actors and community leaders collaborate with one another. Communities sometimes lack
       the nuts and bolts resources (e.g., meeting rooms, conference lines, etc.) to exchange
       information about environmental and health issues with one another. We hope the
       ftnalized plan will include this consideration.

        The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently taking public comment on its
proposed action agenda for a new strategic plan on environmental justice, to be called Plan
EJ2020.1 EPA has stated specific objectives it is considering including as areas of focus for this
new plan. The undersigned commenters recommend that EPA put the bulk of its attention,
authority, commitments, and resources into two of these areas: demonstrating progress on
outcomes that matter to overburdened communities; and creating specific tools and initiatives
that will assist with achieving this progress.
        Many community members and organizations are submitting additional comments. This
set of comments aims to supplement and emphasize cross-cutting actions that would advance
environmental justice across the broad spectrum of the important issues that affect communities.

        JUSTICE CONCERNS. .....................................................................................................17

        A.        Enforcement Initiatives ..........................................................................................17

                  1.        EPA should expand enforcement resources and direct its resources
                            to the most vulnerable communities with greatest need and past
                            and current compliance problems. .............................................................17

                  2.        Require EPA enforcement staff to ensure that the outcomes of
                            cases, including any supplemental environmental projects, provide
                            the best available benefits and pollution and health protections for
                            affected local communities. .......................................................................17

                  3.        EPA should track and regularly evaluate and publish detailed
                            success metrics and results of enforcement cases in achieving
                            objectives, environmental justice, and provide this information to
                            the public and affected communities. ........................................................18

                  4.        EPA should create and publicize an anonymous community and
                            worker hotline for concerns, tips, and complaints about potential
                            violations of environmental laws and regulations. ....................................19

                  5.        For each EPA Region, hold an annual enforcement symposium
                            with communities and state and local enforcement agencies. ...................20

                  6.        Create a formal project for EPA-DOJ community-directed
                            enforcement technical assistance, trainings, and amicus briefs. ................20




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                                            69
                   7.         Create community trainings and information on pollution,
                             compliance, permitting, and enforcement. .................................................20

                  8.         Provide input opportunities, information, and protections for
                             communities living near contaminated and Superfund sites......................21

        B.        Regulatory Tools and Actions ...............................................................................22

                  1.         Update EPA’s approach to assess cumulative risks and impacts
                             based on current science and the need to protect vulnerable
                             communities. ..............................................................................................22

                  2.         EPA should perform a review of permits and strengthen the
                             requirements applicable to all permits, including Title V permits,
                             through state oversight and direction by providing best practices. ............26

                  3.         Revise the minimum public notice requirements for Clean Air Act
                             and other permits, for both major and minor sources, to allow for
                             adequate public review and participation. .................................................26

                  4.         Create a National Clean Air Monitoring Rule to assure strong
                             monitoring and reporting in Clean Air Act Title V permits. .....................26

                  5.         Strengthen Monitoring and Reporting Requirements in Rules. .................28

                             data within EPA programs, to the greatest extent possible. .......................30

                  8.         Integrate enforcement staff and enforcement expertise into the
                             rulemaking process. ...................................................................................31

                  9.         Assess and provide EJ outcomes in rulemakings and permitting,
                             not just process. ..........................................................................................32

                  10.        OEJ should be given authority to set performance measures and
                             evaluate EJ progress annually, as well as give advice and feedback
                             to program staff. .........................................................................................32

 I.       DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS ON OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO
         OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES: MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS FOR
         COMMUNITIES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS.
       To demonstrate that EPA is achieving progress, EPA must make commitments and take
substantive action to reduce environmental health disparities, not merely create more
commitments on process as its prior guidance documents have done.
        EPA must look at, assess, and set goals to achieve improved outcomes for the health and
protection of the environment for communities of color, low-income, and indigenous people. A
long history of discrimination and neglect has produced socioeconomic inequality and has made
people of color and low-income people more vulnerable to the harms of pollution, and with the
least access to safe and healthy environments and natural areas.
        The objective of Executive Order 12898 is not just to increase protection for all and leave
disparities in place – it is to “make achieving environmental justice part of [each Federal
agency’s] mission.” 2
         To achieve this objective, EPA needs to set metrics that assure:
         (1)         The agency is targeting its resources to ensure that people of color and low-
                     income people are experiencing the outcomes of its work as measurable, direct
                     benefits and protections;
         (2)         The agency is achieving the best possible, and greatest achievable results on
                     the ground, in terms of such health and environmental outcomes; and
         (3)         EPA is targeting and taking particular actions that aim to reduce the greater
                     rate of environmental threats and impacts that are occurring for particular
                     communities, correlated with and connected to their race and socioeconomic
                     status, not just strengthen protections in some way and call its work done.

         A.      Increase Agency Resources and Action Focused on Hot Spots: Vulnerable
                 Communities with Disproportionate Need
        To achieve objective one, EPA must ensure that it expands resources and prioritizes its
existing resources to reach the communities that are overburdened by pollution or other toxic
exposures and have disproportionate representation of vulnerable communities of color and low-
income people.
       For example, for fiscal year 2015, EPA has created a “Making A Visible Difference In
Communities” project, where it has selected 50 communities nationwide for particular attention
and resources. 3 To achieve its environmental justice objectives, in Plan EJ2020 EPA must do
more than just choose these 50 communities to make a “visible difference.” And, EPA must do
more than just consider issues related to “smart growth.”

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                          71
      First, EPA should commit to direct resources and apply its authorities to all overburdened
communities meeting key criteria, not just select a limited number.
        Second, EPA should use environmental justice factors to choose communities that will
receive additional attention, action, and resources. For the 2015 project, it is unclear whether or
how environmental justice factors were included in EPA’s determination of which communities
would be part of this project. It is unclear whether all of the communities EPA has chosen are
the communities with the greatest need for environmental and health protection, that they are hot
spots, or that they are communities with particular environmental justice concerns. EPA should
provide transparency and an opportunity for further input, and should extend such opportunities
to communities who may not have had a prior opportunity to provide input, and who seek to
receive the additional protection and attention that this project will provide.
         In particular, as part of Plan EJ2020, EPA should develop an expansive list of all known
hot spot communities or areas that have environmental justice concerns, and that need further
review, agency action, and attention, after taking public notice and comment. EPA should create
this list using factors such as the following:
        (1) the factors contained in EJSCREEN;
       (2) additional health status and health disparity factors included in CalEnviroScreen, 4 and
any other valuable state tools;
      (3) additional indicators that are also linked with environmental justice, public health, and
EPA’s statutory authorities, such as:

             •   whether an area is in nonattainment for a criteria pollutant;
             •   whether an area has elevated cancer risks, as identified in EPA’s Second
                 Integrated Urban Air Toxics Report 5;
             •   whether an area has elevated levels of drinking water or soil contamination,
                 including from legacy pollution or ghost industrial sites 6;
             •   whether a community has Superfund and/or brownfield sites;
             •   whether a community includes facilities with a high number of violations of
                 environmental laws;
             •   whether a community includes major sources regulated under EPA’s air toxics
                 and other permitting programs;

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           72
              •   whether a history of segregation, racial zoning, redlining, and similar forms of
                 discrimination played any role in the proximity between majority-minority
                 neighborhoods and industrial sources, highways, and other pollution sources;
             •   whether a community includes a port or goods movement/transportation hub,
                 and/or is located along or in close proximity to an international border or point of
                 entry including both the U.S.-Mexico, and the U.S.-Canada borders;
             •   whether an area contains mining and/or oil and gas resources or extraction
                 activities;
             •   whether a community is located in a geographical region or area that is
                 particularly susceptible to extreme drought impacts, sea level rise, or other
                 impacts from natural and climate-change related disasters;
             •   whether a community is located on tribal land, or may otherwise be linguistically
                 or geographically isolated;
             •   whether a community is in proximity to one or more facilities that store or use
                 hazardous chemicals 7;
             •   whether a community relies on subsistence farming, fishing, or hunting;
             •   whether an area is largely agricultural, resulting in community members being
                 exposed to pesticides;
             •   whether a community has been the site of repeated environmental health or safety
                 emergencies;
             •   whether an area is identified by other state or federal agencies (including HUD,
                 USDA or DOT) or initiatives such as Partnership for Sustainable Communities,
                 Sustainable Communities/Strong Communities (“SC2”); and
             •   whether a community has equal and meaningful access to parks, green space, and
                 the ability to enjoy natural areas.
       Third, for all identified hot spot communities, EPA should commit to target its resources
and authorities, and create an “all hands on deck” approach for environmental justice.
        For EPA’s existing communities list in the “Making a Visible Difference” project, it is
unclear whether community-specific plans have been or are being developed to protect these
communities, or who is involved in this process other than the regional staff. For the full Plan
EJ2020 list, EPA should direct all offices, departments, and relevant staff at the national and
regional level to create a plan that assesses and uses specific authorities, resources, and actions to
make progress to protect these hot spot communities, after taking public comment, and publish
these plans. As part of these action plans for hot spot communities, EPA should commit to:
(1) increase enforcement and compliance of all existing requirements applicable; (2) reduce air,
water, and waste pollution and toxic exposure, including through use of EPA’s rulemaking,
permitting, and chemical and product control authorities; (3) increase environment-related health
protections and reduce environment-related health problems such as asthma, early mortality

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              73
 including infant mortality, cardiovascular problems, cancer, lost school and work days, high
blood-lead levels, mercury and other toxin-burdens measured, and other health factors of
importance; and (4) improve monitoring, pollution and health information, technical assistance,
and other tools available to help communities protect their own health and environment. 8
        During the course of Plan EJ2020, EPA should regularly audit and include achievement
of pollution reductions, health protections, and compliance progress in hot spot communities as
part of all relevant EPA staff’s performance reviews and staff reports. EPA should include
community groups within the hot spot communities or areas of environmental justice concern as
part of the progress audit process. EPA should publish regular reports on all actions taken to
provide relief in hot spot communities, and a final report on progress achieved or in process as of
2020.
        Notably, each regional office has a shortage of staff capacity to address the state-specific
and local environmental justice issues facing some of their most vulnerable and overburdened
communities, as well as to enforce regulations intended to protect vulnerable communities such
as farmworkers. Indeed, some, if not many, regional offices have fully disbanded their
environmental justice staffs, and are entirely dependent on the volunteer hours of committed
program staff to address pressing environmental justice issues and impacts. When program staff
who have full-time commitments to other areas of work are expected to devote extra, unpaid
hours to address cumulative health and pollution issues facing environmental justice
communities, there can be no realistic expectation that such issues are actually being adequately
addressed. It is imperative that EPA back its commitments to achieving tangible environmental
justice outcomes with full time staff and programmatic commitments beyond the agency’s
Washington, D.C. office, and throughout the reach of the regional offices. In order to make
environmental justice outcomes a reality for many the nation’s most impacted and overburdened
communities, EPA must back its commitments with real human, financial, and programmatic
resources in each of its regional offices, as well as action plans that staff must implement there.
       As further examples of communities that greatly need attention, see the community
impact reports previously submitted to EPA in connection with the agency’s request for
information on cumulative risk and impact assessment, and on the refineries rule. 9


        B.       Achieve Health and Environmental Outcomes and Reduce Injustice
       In response to EPA’s request for comment on example metrics to use in assessing success
on environmental justice concerns and in communities where people of color and low-income

    Further information on these issues is discussed later in these comments. As one example, EPA needs
to require that safety information on pesticide labels appear in Spanish as well as English so that
farmworkers, who are overwhelmingly Latino, know how to protect themselves.

 people are disproportionately affected by pollution, toxic exposures, and EPA’s program actions,
here is a list of some example metrics that EPA should be considering. The important points are:
(1) focus on actual on-the-ground health impacts and not just EPA’s abstract environmental
metrics (which may show progress but not anywhere near the progress communities need and
want); and (2) assess whether EPA is actually addressing and working toward justice and equity,
i.e., not merely whether EPA has strengthened protection, but whether or not EPA has actually
achieved any progress to reduce the disproportionate and unjust nature of the exposures and
other impacts or made a meaningful difference to a particularly affected community. As EPA
did not provide any real guidance on this question in the action framework document, we
encourage EPA to publish a list of potential metrics for substantive objectives, including and in
addition to the below, that it is actually considering and take further comment on this question,
before determining the metrics it will use to assess success.

                 Metrics Outlined to the Agency in Prior Reports and Comments that Focus
                 at the Regional and Local Level, As Well As the National Level.
         EPA should (1) create the above-described cross-cutting projects and metrics to achieve
progress across a number of issues; and (2) direct its staff to assess progress in resolving
environmental justice concerns raised on many different issues nationally, regionally, and
locally.
        On the latter, we direct EPA’s attention, for example, to the 2010 Lawyers’ Committee
for Civil Rights Under Law report. 10 That report provides a list of important issues that EPA
should seek a status report from its staff on to determine if any EJ progress is being made in
program areas, and to commit to do so, where progress is not being made. Those policy
recommendations cover the following areas, among others:

including the need to protect public health and safety from refineries (see, e.g., Petition of United

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                  78
 low-income communities (see, e.g., Comments of Farmworker Justice and Earthjustice, et al.
(Aug. 18, 2014) 15).
        We highlight in particular that noxious air pollution from large industrial and
transportation-related sources has presented a serious health crisis in underserved communities
across the country. That is partly why these Comments emphasize the need for cross-cutting
tools and projects that would particularly help translate into stronger air monitoring, standards,
and enforcement, if EPA prioritized these issues in Plan EJ2020. Recent reports on the harm
caused by soot, and the link between asthma and weak national air standards for ozone and other
pollutants, provide helpful information on this issue and the disparities of air pollution exposures
and impacts. 16
         For example, a 2013 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that
Baltimore, Maryland – a city that is predominately black and home to many highly concentrated
socio-economically distressed neighborhoods – had the highest emissions-related mortality rate
of over 5,600 U.S. cities studied. 17 Fueling this problem are the exceedingly high levels of fine
particulate matter- and ozone-producing volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrogen
oxides (“NOx”) emissions from cars, trucks, and buses that occupy the Baltimore-area’s
congested highways and narrow streets, as well as local coal-fired power plants. The deleterious
impact of air pollution on public health in Baltimore is reflected by the fact that an alarming 20%
of children in Baltimore City have asthma (more than double the national average), and the city’s
pediatric asthma hospitalization rate is among the highest in the nation. 18 In addition, across the
state, black Marylanders are nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white
Marylanders. Air pollution and resulting harm to environmentally burdened communities in the
City and surrounding areas are likely to increase significantly if the Port of Baltimore expands
and brings in fleets of large diesel trucks and rail cars to move goods and other cargo in and out
of the Baltimore.

         Low-income communities and communities of color in and near many other major cities,
from Houston to Los Angeles to Chicago to New York and Newark, are facing similar problems
that require immediate attention from EPA at the national and local levels. EPA’s own Second
Integrated Urban Air Toxics Report and the American Lung Association’s State of The Air
provide strong illustrations of key work that EPA must do to recognize the strong link between
national air standards, health, and the disproportionate impacts felt by environmental justice
communities. In order to address these impacts, EPA must take active and immediate steps to
protect communities from harmful air pollution. 19 As discussed in comments and
reconsideration petitions submitted by community groups into the dockets of these rules, EPA’s
air standards for power plants, refineries, and other sources causing disproportionate harm to
communities of color and low-income communities provide an important opportunity and duty
for EPA to take meaningful action to protect communities by setting health-protective standards,
and standards that assure the maximum achievable degree of pollution protection, and by
requiring the best available fenceline monitoring and enforceability measures. 20
         There is a great need also for EPA and each regional office, specifically, to seek
community input on important regional issues and hot spots, and national issues of particular
regional concern. EPA should require all regions to create action plans, with input and help from
states, local governments, and community members, and include concrete action and progress
metrics in each plan that will help ensure every region sees on-the-ground benefits from Plan
EJ2020 that are tailored to the communities’ needs in that region. Commenters encourage EPA
to require regions to seek input more broadly and increase transparency in how they are
implementing EPA’s environmental justice objectives, including through creating updated
concrete action plans of their own with direct and significant input from local community
groups.
         Commenters note that Region 2 has provided an environmental justice action plan on its
website that includes some significant objectives and concrete projects. 21 But, formal planning
is not translating into sufficient change on the ground. For example, although there are identified
liaisons between Region 2 and affected Tribes, these liaisons are not conferred with sufficient
authority and are not always included in relevant meetings. Ultimately, metrics of performance
are critical to determine impact on the ground and with input from community stakeholders.
EPA should evaluate changes that would ensure that action items produce outcomes that matter
to overburdened communities.

community of farmworkers,.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                             80
         Many, if not most, other EPA Regions do not even have such plans in place, or have only
permitting-specific plans. 22 These are important efforts, but it is unclear to Commenters how
those plans were created, whether community input was received in designing them, and what
kinds of reports and updates will be provided to assure ongoing community input in assessing
progress in achieving the objectives these reports include. EPA must provide educational
opportunities, information, and training so that communities can participate in comment periods
for draft permits and in public hearings. The permitting plan discusses working with other
offices, but often, community groups do not feel that their voices are heard by the actual
decision-makers. One suggestion would be a permit ombudsperson, with whom a community
group could talk, to find out information and express its concerns in situations where the regional
office and HQ rule-writer staff are not responsive to or actively engaging community members.
EPA staff must be directed to listen to and weigh seriously the concerns raised by community
members and this ombudsperson.
        Furthermore, these documents state that EPA is planning to use EJSCREEN to identify
affected communities. This is important as a starting point, but it is not enough not only because
the tool is incomplete and needs to be strengthened as part of the input process EPA has created,
but also because EPA needs to reach out to community groups actively. For example, EPA
should create lists of past community group commenters and engage them early, actively, and
directly on similar matters affecting their communities. EPA must develop a method that allows
a community group to identify itself or register or utilize some way to make their presence
known. Gathering demographic information is important, but this alone does not assure
identification and involvement of the community groups and leaders who can help inform EPA
action. The permitting plans also call for encouraging activities by the permit applicant – but
this assumes that there is a positive relationship between the permittee and the community – and
often that is not the case. Once again, this illustrates the importance of early community
identification and engagement, which involves outreach activities, not just data analysis (which
is important, but not enough).
        Many of the regions also cover vast and dramatically diverse geographic areas – with
Region 9 as one good example of this. The states encompassed in the region are home to a wide
array of industries ranging from pervasive and often extreme oil, mineral, and other natural
resource extraction and refining, to widespread commercial agricultural production, and from
heavy ship, truck, and railroad traffic facilitating the movement of goods and labor from the
region’s ports and other points of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, to some of the nation’s
most robust and concentrated technology and computer science development. As a result of
these all-too-often highly polluting and toxic activities, communities of color, including many
immigrant and linguistically isolated communities, low-income communities, and tribal
communities experience a range of substantial environmental justice impacts. As such, the
region is also home to a robust network of groups and organizations that engage in rigorous
advocacy to address local, state-wide, and national environmental justice concerns. As an
example, Commenters attach comments submitted by the People’s Senate, including a one-year
roadmap, urging reforms of California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control to strengthen

to integrate each regional office in a state-by-state evaluation of how state-level agencies are
engaged in incorporating environmental justice principles into their own permitting and
enforcement practices. This will not only help EPA to adequately assess the environmental
justice issues facing these large regions, but it will also enable EPA to better evaluate the
region’s progress towards achieving environmental justice objectives. State-level
communication, cooperation, and oversight are also key to ensuring, rather than merely
considering, environmentally just permitting and enforcement decisions. As a starting point, all
regions could follow the lead of a region that has first assigned an environmental justice
coordinator to be a liaison for one (or more) dedicated states, allowing them to aim to become an
expert on environmental justice concerns in that state, and work closely with community group
representatives from the assigned state.
        As a part of this particular effort, we further recommend that EPA exercise its oversight
authority to set specific, standardized permitting and enforcement criteria that must be followed
by state agencies issuing and/or enforcing hazardous waste, air, and water permits to operate;
permits to construct; closure or post-closure clean-up and remediation permits under the Clean
Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; as well as
enforcing Worker Protection Standards for agricultural workers under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, among others. Such standards should plainly incorporate strong
metrics to account for existing cumulative health and environmental burdens in the areas in
which new polluting facilities are proposed, or have already been sited and are operating, and
should ensure that adequate financial assurances are obtained and safeguarded prior to issuing
permit modifications, new permits, or post-closure permits. These standards should also include
metrics for ensuring that safeguards for workers and members of the community are rigorously
enforced.
         Beyond engaging with each state-level agency in the region, we further recommend that
EPA reach out to and engage with local and municipal agencies and governments, as well as
tribal governments, who have decision-making power over land use and permitting decisions that
detrimentally and disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities
in all of each region’s states. Engaging with such agencies would directly assist EPA in ensuring
meaningful inter-agency co-operation to achieve environmental justice goals, as contemplated in
both its 2014 and 2020 EJ plans. For example, EPA’s Enhanced Public Participation during
permit review is a document EPA should promote with state and local governments to increase
community engagement and input. At the same time, EPA needs to work with states to assist

 and require them to do more than just expand process steps or public participation, but also to set
and achieve substantive environmental justice objectives, as discussed above for EPA itself. 24
        We also strongly recommend that EPA exercise its authority to support the existing and
future efforts of the regional offices to engage in program development aimed at addressing
climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation on environmental justice communities.
Across many regions, environmental justice groups are at the forefront of resiliency planning,
conducting research, and identifying innovative strategies, 25 and must be involved as leaders in
EPA’s national and regional actions on global warming.

        Many of the regional efforts should ensure that EPA also commit to outreach, education,
and communication to better understand the needs of native and tribal communities which may
face non-traditional EPA environmental justice issues. For example, Region 8 has unique issues
EPA should consider in a regional environmental justice strategy alongside urban issues, such as
mitigating acid mine drainage; abandoned mine cleanup; health impacts due to oil and gas
development, agricultural runoff, nitrogen deposition in mountain areas; and energy-related
permitting and siting issues. The region is also home to some of the most impoverished tribal
communities in the country who have fundamental infrastructure needs and lack environmental
enforcement assistance and resources. The Tribes also need EPA trainings to strengthen their
governmental programs and EPA educational meetings to strengthen tribal community
awareness. EPA should consider participating in tribal college environmental programs too.
EPA received good advice on implementing its environmental justice goals in Indian Country
through the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council recommendations. 26 As another
example, for many or most federal projects in Alaska, only “foreign” languages, such as Hmong
and Filipino, are included to translate and protect the interests and needs of limited English
proficient (“LEP”) persons. But, as shown in recent cases in Alaska, with both Yup’ik and
Gwitch’in LEP for voting under the Voting Rights Act, it is important for EPA to prioritize the
inclusion of native and indigenous languages. 27 These recommendations should be implemented
when EPA interacts with Tribes in various regions.


24
  As a survey of environmental justice policies showed, many states have procedural steps or
requirements in place, but those are insufficient alone, without additional substantive limits, measures,
targets, and requirements, to actually reduce the amount of pollution, toxic exposures, and environmental
injustices that communities face. See J. Owley, et al., Symbolic Politics for Disempowered Communities:

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                83
 II.     TO DEEPEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PRACTICE, CREATE NEW
        CROSS-CUTTING INITIATIVES AND TOOLS THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE
        HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT OF OVERBURDENED AND VULNERABLE
        COMMUNITIES WITH PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
        CONCERNS.
       In addition to creating the metrics and actions described above, EPA should create the
following national initiatives and tools to advance environmental justice.

        A.       Enforcement Initiatives
                 1.       EPA should expand enforcement resources and direct its resources to
                          the most vulnerable communities with greatest need and past and
                          current compliance problems.
        As part of setting EPA’s next national enforcement initiatives, EPA should increase
enforcement resources and ensure broad community input and outreach, not just seek comment
on its website or through the Federal Register. EPA should use EJSCREEN and other
environmental justice metrics, as described in these and other comments EPA has received, to
ensure targeting of initiatives and enforcement resources to achieve environmental justice
objectives.

                 2.       Require EPA enforcement staff to ensure that the outcomes of cases,
                          including any supplemental environmental projects, provide the best
                          available benefits and pollution and health protections for affected
                          local communities.
       To strengthen the demonstrated outcomes of enforcement cases for communities, EPA
should take at least the following three key steps:

                 •    Community Input During Enforcement. EPA has previously made
                      commitments to include community input in enforcement, but in many
                      instances that input has not been sought or has not been utilized in a way that
                      allows community members to affect the result of a consent decree or a
                      supplemental environmental project (“SEP”) chosen by EPA/DOJ. As part of
                      Plan EJ2020, EPA should do an audit of prior cases; report on where there
                      was community input and which groups were contacted; report on the results;
                      and provide a report on best practices and specific actions that should be used
                      across the board. Where possible, EPA should modify prior enforcement
                      results to better protect communities. For new cases: EPA should require
                      enforcement staff to identify community groups and contact them as early as
                      possible during an action to seek input on the case objectives and results,
                      including any supplemental environmental projects under consideration. EPA
                      should ensure that there is a sufficient public comment period for consent
                      decrees and settlements to allow for meaningful community input, and that
                      this is publicized through direct communication and in other ways in the
                      affected community, not just in the Federal Register and on-line.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            84
                  •    Achieve Community Protections As Part of Case Results and
                      Implementation. EPA should require each proposed consent decree or
                      settlement to include a clear method and role for community input as well as a
                      community-focused benefit and protection objective. EPA should assess the
                      results of enforcement cases based on community outcomes achieved,
                      including metrics described earlier in these comments. EPA should provide
                      information to community members on requirements, monitoring, and other
                      components of successful enforcement cases so they can help track and
                      receive the full benefit of these results over time as enforcement decrees,
                      settlements, and court orders are implemented. EPA should create an ongoing
                      Community Advisory Board or host regular meetings with the community and
                      representatives during enforcement and throughout implementation to have
                      continual meaningful engagement and input. EPA should require that copies
                      of annual reports go to local community or civic groups to help keep the
                      community informed.

                 •    Publish and Disseminate Lists of Best Practices to Increase Community
                      Protections. EPA should perform an audit, with input from pollution control
                      and monitoring companies, and create a list of best practices and technologies
                      available for particular industries, pollutants, and pollution controls and
                      monitoring methods. EPA should update this list and publish it annually so
                      that it is available to community members evaluating permits, regulations, and
                      bringing their own enforcement actions. Before proposing a component of a
                      consent decree or settlement, EPA should assess whether it is the best
                      available method already in use in another settlement, decree, or a state or
                      local jurisdiction by the same or a similar industry or company at a different
                      facility. EPA should set up a clear method of information-sharing to assist in
                      this process, including through required communications within the agency
                      and with state and local agencies.

                 3.       EPA should track and regularly evaluate and publish detailed success
                          metrics and results of enforcement cases in achieving objectives,
                          environmental justice, and provide this information to the public and
                          affected communities.
        EPA often issues a press release when it achieves success in an enforcement case, listing
the objectives that will be achieved. But, as the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) found
after evaluating EPA’s refinery enforcement initiative, EPA needs to better assess the success of
meeting requirements of consent decrees and settlements, and publish that information on a
regular, at least annual, basis (or more often, depending on the consent decree and settlement). 28
EPA should also assure that this is provided to communities in an understandable way, so
communities can help assess ongoing results and progress achieved.

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           85
                  4.       EPA should create and publicize an anonymous community and
                          worker hotline for concerns, tips, and complaints about potential
                          violations of environmental laws and regulations.
        Currently, EPA has a website that is not known to most community members and not
useable without computer access. 29 This website directs people who wish to phone in a
complaint to another site that says it is necessary to find the correct EPA Region. The website
also states that it may be better to call a state or local agency, rather than EPA. This system is
not workable or useful for many, if not most, community members with environmental and
health concerns in vulnerable communities.
        There should be a clear and easy to use, well-publicized method to phone in anonymous
complaints. EPA should provide a public log of complaints received; the office or department,
including contact information, to which the complaint was directed; and ultimate follow-up
action (if any) or other outcome. EPA, on the regional websites, could also easily post contact
information for regional state emergency or hotline numbers.
        It is important that EPA publicize a complaint mechanism to ensure it particularly
reaches workers and community members in overburdened communities with environmental
justice concerns. EPA should use EJSCREEN and other metrics to ensure that community
members whose primary language is not English have the necessary information and access to
submit complaints, and receive follow-up information.
        Anonymous reporting is especially important for workers who may have inside
information about a problem that needs to be fixed, maintenance that could avoid a disaster, or
other issue that is important to correct to prevent both additional pollution and immediate injury
or loss of life.
        In addition, EPA should update its tips and complaints website to keep up with the times,
and allow for easy submission of photos, video, GPS data, air monitoring data collected
remotely, etc., to accompany a complaint. The public needs to be able to submit information that
will be meaningful and useable for enforcement if they have this type of information. In
addition, as discussed later, EPA needs to strengthen the availability of public information that
community members can consult to assess compliance.
        For example, EPA should review the best practices in use in some states or local areas,
such as the Fresno Environmental Reporting Network (“FERN”) in Fresno County, CA, 30 and
the Kern Environmental Enforcement Network (“KEEN”), in Kern County, CA. 31 FERN
provides information on how to submit complaints through multiple methods, and allows
multilingual reporting. It even allows people to receive email alerts of problems reported in the
area, so that other community members can receive the immediate benefit of knowing if there is

 an immediate potential health or safety concern they should be aware of. As stated on its
website: “FERN is modeled after a successful project, the Imperial Visions Action Network. In
the first two years IVAN generated violations leading to $90,000 in penalties.” 32 IVAN has
since been expanded to other communities as well, as an “Environmental Monitoring System that
connects the community with real people that can help solve local environmental problems.” 33
                 5.       For each EPA Region, hold an annual enforcement symposium with
                          communities and state and local enforcement agencies.
        For each region, EPA should hold an annual meeting that brings together affected
communities, EPA, state, and local environmental enforcement agencies to increase EPA’s
enforcement impact and share information. There should be a community complaint and
comment mechanism as part of this meeting. This meeting should also include a transparent
discussion of identified compliance problems in the region; strategies to address those; and ways
in which communities can have input, gain additional information, or in some instances assist in
addressing such problems. This meeting should also include technical assistance and other
information for community members. Some states – such as California – and regions previously
have held these kinds of events, and EPA should contact staff there to seek information on best
practices in how to organize and implement this kind of event.
                 6.       Create a formal project for EPA-DOJ community-directed
                          enforcement technical assistance, trainings, and amicus briefs.
        EPA should create a work-group of EPA and DOJ enforcement staff who are available to
provide technical assistance and enforcement trainings for community members who seek to
evaluate potential problems arising from pollution or other toxic exposures, and decide whether
to bring cases themselves that EPA/DOJ does not have the resources to bring directly. This
group should be part of trainings and publicized widely to affected communities.
        As part of this work-group, EPA and DOJ should track enforcement cases and actively
consider submitting an amicus brief in federal courts, especially courts of appeals, where such a
brief could make a difference to: strengthen applicable precedent on enforcement; ensure an
incentive for facilities to comply rather than violate environmental laws; and assist in achieving a
positive result for communities where EPA-DOJ did not have sufficient resources to bring a full
enforcement case. EPA should actively seek out cases for potential amicus briefs.

                 7.       Create community trainings and information on pollution,
                          compliance, permitting, and enforcement.
        EPA has made it a priority to create “Next Generation” monitoring and compliance tools
in individual enforcement cases, even while it is going backward in rules and monitoring

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           87
 networks – which are important issues for Plan EJ2020 to address, as discussed later. 34 It is
important that EPA provide training and information to communities so that they can understand
how to interpret and use this information, and receive the full benefits that this project is
intended to provide. EPA should hold regular community trainings and provide information on
pollution, toxic exposures due to drift, monitoring data, compliance and enforcement to assist
community members in understanding all of the ways in which they can help assure compliance
and strengthen environmental enforcement. EPA provides some of these kinds of resources
online, but they are difficult for community members to find, and not all are publicly available.
EPA should create a single place where community members can find and access available
information, publicize this widely for community members, and also hold additional trainings in
the regions for more in-depth dissemination of information that communities need to engage
actively in permitting and enforcement matters.
        As a good example, EPA Region 4 has scheduled their 14th Community Involvement
Training Conference on August 4-6, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. Events such as this are very
important. EPA also must provide a mechanism by which poor and underserved communities
can participate in this and other similar events. EPA has arranged for participation via telephone
for those who cannot attend in person, but the phone is no substitute for the value of training or
other informal and personal connections and discussions that can occur in person.
                 8.       Provide input opportunities, information, and protections for
                          communities living near contaminated and Superfund sites.
        There is a strong need to reform and address environmental justice issues in all aspects of
the Superfund program, including in terms of site prioritization, clean-up, and oversight.
Experience at the General Motors Superfund Site in Massena, New York, a massive PCB dump
directly adjacent to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, illustrates this. EPA has long recognized the
need to take the cultural and historical concerns of Tribes into account when conducting
Superfund remediations, and EPA recognized that because “the people of the St. Regis Mohawk
Tribe … have a cultural and spiritual link to the St. Lawrence Environment[,]” which they call
Akwesasne, “[s]pecial consideration must be given to Native American concerns in evaluating
and remediating the site.” 35 Yet EPA has persistently failed to incorporate the suggestions of the
Tribe in its oversight of remedial actions, and the site is not expected to be cleaned up until 2017

 – over thirty years after the site was first listed on the National Priorities List, even though there
is significant PCB contamination. 36
        As further examples of Superfund issues some supposedly “closed” Superfund sites are
not closed at all – no fence, no posting, tanks labeled “permanently closed” but that are broken
open, etc., with nothing to warn or prevent children or adults from going onto the site. In
addition to a hotline to report issues like this, as noted above, EPA should track and ensure
protections to keep these sites closed and inform communities of the dangers of entering them.
This information needs to be provided in languages used by all local community members.
        In addition, a common concern expressed by community groups is the lack of
meaningful, active EPA community engagement. Communities often feel that they are not
considered to be important stakeholders in planned remediation activities in their communities.
One example involves the Jacksonville Showcase community, where EPA has developed a
strong relationship with the residential community group near a hazardous waste site. However,
there is a former worker population that has not been included in EPA’s activities and, as such,
this community has not received protections that should come from interaction with state, local,
or federal environmental and health agencies. EPA must work actively to ensure the
involvement of multiple community voices and groups in clean-up processes.

         B.      Regulatory Tools and Actions
                 1.       Update EPA’s approach to assess cumulative risks and impacts based
                          on current science and the need to protect vulnerable communities.
        EPA must carry forward and follow through on its commitment from Plan EJ 2014 to
address cumulative impacts, including cumulative risks. 37 EPA’s approach to assessing
environmental health threats and impacts is woefully outdated and behind the science. This
problem comes to a head in clean air, toxics, pesticides, civil rights enforcement, and other
actions where EPA is required to assess health risks and impacts. But failing to follow the
current science also harms the agency’s effort to account for and address vulnerabilities and
environmental justice concerns across a broader range of its actions as well. EPA must take
action to update its guidance. EJSCREEN is a screening tool that addresses only a few factors
and is no substitute for the policies and protocols that EPA must use in actually deciding what
action to take at the program level.
        The dire reality is that environmental hazards affect some communities much more than
others. Pollution and polluting sources are often concentrated together, overburdening and
overwhelming communities and populations, and causing greater health effects and safety

failed to keep up with current science and do not account for real-world impacts, jeopardize the
health of communities surrounded by sources of pollution – such as coal plants, refineries,
cement kilns, chemical plants, metal smelters, incinerators, dry cleaners, highways, truck routes,
landfills, Superfund, and other hazardous waste sites.
        In order to fulfill the agency’s renewed commitment to environmental justice and the
recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, EPA
must update its approach to account for the cumulative impacts and risks faced from early-in-life
exposure (including childhood) and from exposure to multiple sources, as well as the increased
vulnerability from socioeconomic stressors and multiple pollutant and pathway exposures. To
this end, we urge EPA to commit to do the following as part of Plan EJ2020:

                          a) EPA must incorporate the real-world experience and perspective
                             of people who live in communities that are overburdened by
                             pollution and other environmental hazards.
        Too many communities of color and lower income communities are exposed to a
disproportionate share of air pollution and all of the resulting health risks and impacts.
Communities have previously submitted statements that summarize the situation and provide
narratives from various example communities around the United States that describe the on-the-
ground impact of EPA’s scientific policy decisions and the urgency of reforms in risk assessment
practices. 39
                          b) EPA must advance environmental justice and protect public
                             health by establishing guidance that provides a means to reduce
                             cumulative impacts in overburdened communities.
       There is clear and mounting evidence that the concentration of environmental hazards in
lower income communities and communities of color threatens public health and that current risk
assessment practices contribute to environmental inequities and increase disparities. Experts
have identified addressing cumulative impacts as a critical step to ensuring environmental justice
and reducing disparities. At minimum, this must include:

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                    90
                  (1) Immediately updating existing guidelines for conducting risk-based
                     assessments to incorporate mechanisms for accounting for the cumulative
                     impacts of multiple exposures and underlying vulnerabilities; and
                 (2) Moving beyond current risk frameworks and incorporating alternate methods
                     to assess health threats from environmental exposures in a way that will better
                     capture the impacts faced by overburdened communities and support policies
                     to reduce them.
       Regarding item (1) above, most urgently, where its authorities direct it to assess risk,
EPA must use the best available current science to do so. EPA can and must vastly improve its
approach by updating existing risk assessment guidelines to incorporate the science on
cumulative risk and impacts, including by implementing the following:

        •    Account for individual-level vulnerability in risk assessments by better incorporating
             the vulnerability of children, early-life exposures, and the developing fetus into risk
             assessment methods:
                             Account for increased susceptibility by using age-dependent
                              adjustment factors for all carcinogens, not just known mutagens.
                             Pre-natal susceptibility: Account for increased susceptibility by using a
                              pre-natal adjustment factor for all carcinogens of at least 10X.
                             For chronic non-cancer risk, consult and apply child-specific reference
                              values (such as those created by California EPA scientists), where
                              available.
                             If child-specific reference values are unavailable, consult science on
                              early exposure impacts, and use an additional default factor of at least
                              10X.

        •    Account for community level vulnerability by including factors to account for
             increased vulnerability based on demographic differences, as part of the risk
             assessment. EPA also must fully integrate the findings of its environmental justice
             analyses into its risk assessments and rulemakings, and set stronger pollution limits to
             provide environmental justice.

        •    Assess the cumulative burden of exposures to multiple pollutants and sources via
             multiple pathways:
                             Assess and aggregate exposure from multiple pathways – including by
                              adding inhalation and non-inhalation-based cancer risks.
                             Include the interaction of multiple pollutants.
                             Account for exposure to multiple sources. Until EPA has a specific
                              mechanism for estimating total exposures, a default or uncertainty
                              factor of at least 10X should be used to provide overburdened
                              communities with the protection they need now.


EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              91
         •    Account for cumulative impacts of multiple exposures and vulnerabilities by shifting
             the level of risk which triggers policy action.
                    Reduce EPA’s benchmark of what it considers acceptable lifetime cancer risk,
                     instead of relying on the outdated upper limit of 100-in-a-million. This
                     benchmark is way too high, and is completely unacceptable to affected
                     communities who are bombarded by high levels of pollution from many
                     different sources, emitting many pollutants that can cause both additive and
                     synergistic harm, and experience exposure through multiple pathways.
                    Use a Margin of Exposure (“MOE”) framework for non-cancer impacts and
                     adjust the target MOE according to known vulnerability factors.

        •    In the face of increasing evidence calling into question the assumption of a safe or
             acceptable level of exposure, EPA should also consider reforming risk assessments to
             support reducing risks to the lowest possible level to protect public health, rather than
             suggest that there is a safe or acceptable level.
        Prior comments submitted to EPA providing more detail on these issues are available in
the dockets of the Office of Science Advisor and air office, among others. 40
        Commenters also wish to highlight that EPA should be requiring and using a full Health
Impact Assessment (“HIA”) wherever possible, in addition to looking at health risks where
directed by law. An HIA is a more detailed and comprehensive tool to understand the impacts of
pollution on a community that already includes significant health burdens and legacy pollution.
The Port of Los Angeles HIA provides an example of the type of impact assessment that should
be used more often. 41
        In addition, continued development of EJSCREEN and similar tools is also recommended
to support communities in learning more about the environmental justice threats that surround
them, so that communities know which pollutants to track and which monitoring tools will be
most useful. EJSCREEN is a screening tool, and is no substitute for the long-overdue updates to
EPA’s policy and protocol to assess cumulative risks and impacts, but these tools can work
together to strengthen information available to communities, EPA, and state and local agencies,
as well as other stakeholders.

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                    92
                  2.       EPA should perform a review of permits and strengthen the
                          requirements applicable to all permits, including Title V permits,
                          through state oversight and direction by providing best practices.
         As some commenters, such as the Coalition For A Safe Environment, have previously
proposed, EPA should create a permit taskforce – including one specific to Clean Air Act Title
V, as well as for CWA permits – that updates EPA’s prior assessments with meaningful action
steps. Each permit-focused taskforce should be charged with an independent review and
evaluation of the quality of permits, including specific areas that need strengthening including:
monitoring, reporting, public information, and other key components needed to assure
compliance, including through public review and enforcement. EPA should provide a report and
use this in oversight of states, and provide it for public commenters, along with a clear direction
to lift all permits up to a higher level of essential enforcement requirements. The objective of
this project would be to strengthen environmental justice protections for communities with a
significant number of permitted facilities.

                 3.       Revise the minimum public notice requirements for Clean Air Act
                          and other permits, for both major and minor sources, to allow for
                          adequate public review and participation.
         To give more community members a chance to learn about permits that govern facilities
in their area (including Clean Air Act Title V, PSD, NSR, Clean Water Act, and other types of
permits), EPA should require facilities and/or state agencies to post permit applications and the
proposed draft permit online on a publicly available website at the start of the public notice
period. EPA should also ensure that notification occurs in relevant languages for the affected
nearby communities.
        It is a serious problem that some sources apply for and receive minor source permits
without adequate review, often without submitting proper data showing that they are minor
rather than major. A minor source often escapes the most protective requirements under the
Clean Air Act, which can lead to communities facing even higher, unfair, and unlawful levels of
pollution. EPA must revise its minor source permit rules to ensure public notice of all minor
source permitting decisions.
       In addition, EPA should require states to maintain a mailing list to notify interested
persons of draft permits and final permits via email and telephone (for people without email
access), for major and minor sources.

                 4.       Create a National Clean Air Monitoring Rule to assure strong
                          monitoring and reporting in Clean Air Act Title V permits.
       In addition to the taskforce and to complement its work, as part of Plan EJ2020, EPA
should create a national clean air monitoring rule that will include specific requirements for
monitoring, reporting, and public disclosure of emissions data for all air permits.
       Years ago, EPA acknowledged the need to implement the Act’s enhanced monitoring
requirements by setting regulatory requirements, but it has not promulgated a national rule and




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           93
 instead has proposed to do so rule-by-rule and permit-by-permit. 42 EPA has often failed to
follow through on these proposals. Many rules for specific source categories and many permits
continue to lack monitoring requirements sufficient to ensure compliance with emission
standards and to provide contemporaneous information on emissions to people exposed to those
emissions in the community. In many cases, rules and permits require only a single stack test,
once a year (or even less often) that does not reflect ongoing emission levels and does not assure
continuous compliance. EPA has previously even taken action to prevent states from
implementing supplementary, stronger monitoring requirements, which was struck down in
court. 43 A national rule is needed to require all permits to include monitoring necessary to assure
compliance.
        The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set monitoring provisions to assure continuous
compliance with emission standards. 44 The Act also requires emission standards to be
continuous and apply at all times. 45 Many air sources, such as refineries, have a long history of
violations, malfunctions, and other exceedances of the standards. 46 EPA is in the process of
removing the unlawful SSM exemption that is included in some current standards, but in view of

requires permits to contain “conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with applicable
requirements of [the Act];” and to include “monitoring … requirements to assure compliance with the
permit terms and conditions.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661c(a), (c). As the Senate Report accompanying the Act
summarized: “EPA must require reasonable monitoring … requirements that are adequate to assure
compliance.” S. Rep. No. 101-228, at 350 (1989), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385, 3733. Pursuant
to its rulemaking authority and duty under Title V, 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(b)(2) and § 7661c(b), EPA has
issued regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 70 that affirm these requirements. 40 C.F.R. § 70.6(a)(3)(i)(B)
requires “monitoring sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period that are representative
of the source’s compliance.” Section 70.6(c)(1) requires all Part 70 permits to contain “testing,
monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and
conditions of the permit.”

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                   94
 the record of the industry’s reliance on that exemption, effective monitoring is required to assure
compliance with the standards at all times. EPA needs to require truly “enhanced monitoring” in
a national rule that will assure compliance with all air standards in permits, without further delay.
The agency’s compliance assurance monitoring rule is outdated and woefully inadequate for this
purpose, and does not even purport to cover all sources covered by EPA rules and Title V
permits.
         EPA’s own Enforcement Division is also implementing enhanced monitoring
requirements to assure compliance in its refinery enforcement initiative, and EPA must require,
at least, what its division is requiring as part of its “next generation compliance” policy. 47 EPA
as a whole should follow this policy and implement the Act’s enhanced monitoring requirements
in this rulemaking.
       In addition, significant advancements in monitoring have occurred in recent years. There
are newly available technologies and monitoring techniques to assure compliance with air
emission standards. In particular, more time-resolved, higher data-quality-producing fence-line
monitoring protocols have been implemented at specific refineries through enforcement suits
brought by EPA and negotiations with community groups. As examples, Commenters highlight
the EPA consent decrees at Shell Deer Park and BP Whiting, and the community monitoring
protocol set up at Chevron Richmond, and attach a summary of some of these monitoring
protocols. 48
        To date, EPA has not followed up to create a national monitoring rule addressing the
monitoring needs outlined above, or to ensure that permits include such requirements. This is
the kind of national program action that would help communities overburdened with air
pollution, who are disproportionately communities of color and low-income communities. It is
also extremely important for EPA to strengthen and require fence-line monitoring on a case-by-
case basis in industry-specific rules and facility-specific enforcement actions. In addition,
though, EPA must set national requirements to ensure stronger monitoring reaches more
communities faster and in a more efficient way than a rule-by-rule approach allows.

                 5.       Strengthen Monitoring and Reporting Requirements in Rules.
         EPA needs to ensure that its rules provide for the best available monitoring, reporting,
and public transparency requirements for the purposes of assessing and enforcing compliance.
Its rules need to facilitate both government and affected community enforcement, such as
through citizen actions, where necessary. Enforcement staff involved in review of permitting
programs should be directed to ensure that states are issuing enforceable permits.
        To achieve this objective, EPA should perform a systematic review of monitoring and
reporting requirements in national standards and issue a publicly available report on the results.
With input from the enforcement division and the public, EPA should assess the best available

 monitoring requirements, such as: continuous emissions monitoring (“CEMS”) and digital
camera and video monitoring; or continuous parametric monitoring and frequent stack testing for
any pollutants/points where CEMS is not yet available; the best available reporting and
transparency requirements: e.g., where electronic reports of data collected go directly to state
agencies and EPA, and are made publicly available in or near real time on-line, in a format that
the public can review and understand. As part of this review, EPA should also consult the states
to see the best practices in use for monitoring, testing, and reporting, as well as air pollution and
monitoring control companies and trade associations, such as the Institute of Clean Air
Companies (“ICAC”).
        To achieve environmental justice objectives, EPA must recognize that community
members have a basic right to know what is going into their environment so that they can use
this information to better protect their own health and advocate for stronger protection, and so
that they can know whether or not a source is in compliance or needs action to bring it into
compliance.
        To date, EPA has been moving in the opposite direction. For example, as detailed in
comments filed in November 2014, EPA has proposed to weaken or forego public participation
requirements for various monitoring programs that are particularly critical to people living in
disadvantaged communities. 49 In addition, many rules include, at most, an initial, one-time stack
emission test, or very delayed (i.e., 5-year periodic one-time tests). Many rules include only on-
site recordkeeping for agency inspection, without the ability for public review or transparency.
And in some instances, EPA has eliminated the use of special purpose monitors to assess
compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. EPA has also created biased
defaults that assume “no pollution” whenever there is a concern about the quality of data, rather
than using that data to trigger the need for areas/sources to prove that data was incorrect. This
bias means that areas with poor resources are more likely to be assumed “clean” and there is
actually an incentive not to invest in quality assurance/control. These are all serious problems
that particularly affect communities with large numbers of sources, including many communities
of color and low-income communities. Similar issues plague farmworker and other low-income
worker communities, who have little reliable information about the number of acute pesticide
and other types of chemical poisonings in the workplace; workers fear retaliation if they
voluntarily report and there is no national pesticide incident reporting system or effective
chemical safety risk reporting system that could be utilized by clinicians and others who work
with farmworkers, chemical plant, refinery, or other workers.

                 6.       Strengthen Air Monitoring Networks, Requirements, and Data.
      EPA should invest in additional ambient air monitors. EPA should prioritize siting those
monitors in communities identified as hot spots for environmental justice.
       To create strong monitoring networks across the country, EPA should incorporate
environmental justice principles when reviewing and approving air monitoring network plans.
Consistent with the Clean Air Act’s requirements that states assure air quality for all people,

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            96
 EPA’s review of these plans should assess whether a given air monitoring network is producing
data that represents what people are breathing in overburdened communities. 50
         In addition to the ambient air monitoring network, EPA should identify low-income
communities and communities of color and target continuous, real-time fenceline monitoring at
facilities in those communities, in line with Executive Order 12,898. 51 Other “advanced
monitoring” practices should be required in environmental justice communities as well,
including lower-cost monitors that can be installed in many locations, monitors that produce data
in real time, and monitors that present data in ways that a layperson can understand. 52 Infrequent
periodic stack tests are completely insufficient to assess and assure compliance. Further, all
monitoring data must be reported to the public in or near real time, in a useable and
understandable form, and not just collected for agencies to look at, if they so choose. EPA
should also include indoor air quality monitoring under the umbrella of advanced monitoring, so
that community members have a fuller understanding of the air quality they experience within
their communities.

                 7.       Create a policy to use citizen-collected science and monitoring data
                          within EPA programs, to the greatest extent possible.
        Community air monitoring must play an important role in creating strong air quality
monitoring networks for low-income communities and communities of color. EPA should
prioritize the acceptance of monitoring data that communities produce for themselves, and act as
a partner and a resource for communities working to address air quality threats.
        To this end, EPA has begun creating projects and grants to provide training and
technology to encourage and assist community members to help assess air quality and other
environmental problems. Yet, frequently when community members have brought data showing
an air pollution problem or air standard exceedance to EPA, EPA has ignored and refused to use
these data. As one recent example, community members in Galena Park in Houston, TX
provided community monitoring data showing PM2.5 exceedances. 53 Yet, EPA neither
recognized these data as showing a violation that required the area to be found to be in
nonattainment for PM2.5, nor performed any independent monitoring or verification to assess
whether, with some additional work or data collection on EPA’s part, the data could be used to

   Comments of Sierra Club, et al. at 4 (Sept. 29, 2014), EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0918-0295 (submitting
data showing that “particulate matter levels are often well above the NAAQS standard in this area,”
including at a monitor near the Early Head Start building (a childhood development center serving
children between 0-3 years of age), reporting recorded particulate matter daily average levels ranging
from 7.8 to 44.7 micrograms per cubic meter, with an average value of 20.7).




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                  97
 address the clear problem they showed. 54 Thus, even though there is clearly a particulate matter
problem in the air in this Houston neighborhood, and even though the community spent time and
resources to gather air monitoring data to supplement the data EPA already had, the community
was not designated as nonattainment and will not receive the health protections that would come
from such a designation.
        Rather than allow examples like this to continue to occur, EPA must set clear guidelines
and a clear policy to recognize citizen science and monitoring, especially when citizen-provided
data show environmental problems, toxic exposures, or violations, with input from regions and
community groups. EPA should work with the states and local agencies to encourage them to do
the same, following best practices. These guidelines should be predicated on an acceptance of
the principles of community-based monitoring. As part of these:
                     First, EPA should provide clear instruction to community members who will
                      be collecting data on what quality assurance and quality control protocols or
                      steps must be taken for the data to be considered as equally reliable as
                      federally monitored data.
                     Second, if citizens provide data that EPA believes do not meet these criteria
                      for any reason, then EPA should presume such data are at least relevant, rather
                      than just ignoring the data as though they were never collected and show
                      nothing. In particular, EPA should direct its staff to ensure that when citizens
                      submit data suggesting there is an environmental problem, then rather than
                      reject or ignore these data, staff must take additional action to attempt to
                      verify those data, show the verification process used, use independent
                      monitoring to see if the data can be replicated using EPA methods, and/or to
                      require a facility to show that the data do not demonstrate a violation or
                      illustrate another environmental problem.
                 8.       Integrate enforcement staff and enforcement expertise into the
                          rulemaking process.
        As part of each significant rulemaking in its air, water, waste, pesticides, and other
programs, EPA should make it a requirement for rulewriters to request and receive an
independent review and report on recommendations from its enforcement division to assess and
strengthen monitoring, reporting, and other enforcement-related requirements in the rule. This
report should be made available in the rulemaking docket as part of the public comment process.
This review and report should both focus on what is needed to strengthen government
enforcement and ensure that the rule is also enforceable by affected community members.
       In addition, OECA staff should take a bigger role, and rulewriters themselves should be
required to consider and address how to assure enforceability and compliance, as discussed
above, by looking at: (1) the data that will be collected to assess compliance, if it includes
enough detail and will be sufficiently understandable to assess compliance; (2) how it will be
made available to the public as well as government agencies; (3) how timely will the data be

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                               98
 available, so that corrective action can be taken and there are no concerns that the lag will
prevent effective enforcement; and (4) if the rule will assure that a third party reviewing
information can actually assess and determine compliance or a violation?
                  9.      Assess and provide EJ outcomes in rulemakings and permitting, not
                          just process.
         In some recent public statements, EPA has referred to particular rules as examples of how
EPA is implementing environmental justice objectives in rulemaking and other actions. For
example, EPA pointed to the pending Refineries air toxics rule under Clean Air Act § 7412. 55
Commenters do not believe that holding public workshops or hearings, alone, illustrates success
for environmental justice objectives. There must be both truly meaningful public participation
and input throughout the process, and a commitment to achieving strong substantive outcomes to
benefit affected communities. 56 Most importantly, EPA must consider and evaluate the results
of the final rule, according to metrics of actual environmental health protections achieved,
pollution reduced, monitoring and enforceability mechanisms strengthened, and must do so by
comparison with the best available metrics, as discussed above, to determine whether or not it
has actually achieved environmental justice objectives in a rulemaking. For the refineries rule,
those are the metrics community members will be using, to assess whether indeed EPA has
fulfilled its objective to provide environmental justice, not the number of public hearings or
workshops held.
        Regarding regulations and permitting, EPA should direct each regulatory and permitting
program office or division to provide an audit and a report on the top ways in which the program
office or division could strengthen the substantive outcomes for vulnerable communities in the
work that it does, and publish those reports. Commenters highlight especially the concerns about
how a history of problems with zoning or lack thereof have caused particularly disproportionate
siting and pollution burdens for communities of color and low-income communities; the
permitting process must reduce these disparities, not make them worse or ignore them. 57
                  10.     OEJ should be given authority to set performance measures and
                          evaluate EJ progress annually, as well as give advice and feedback to
                          program staff.
        On the metrics and objectives EPA chooses to establish for Plan EJ 2020, EPA should
create a clear ongoing role for the Office of Environmental Justice to provide the particular
expertise they have on EPA’s program work and give input on ways that EPA’s actions must be
strengthened substantively to assure environmental justice. This role must include not only

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                99
 helping to connect community stakeholders into EPA’s work in terms of the process, but also
evaluating and providing feedback to program staff on substance and concrete results in
achieving environmental justice objectives. In addition, OEJ, in consultation with the National
Environmental Justice Advisory Council, should have authority for reviewing, auditing, and
providing a public progress report that is independent from EPA program staff’s self-evaluations,
and is included in EPA’s regular reports. OEJ should directly seek affected community
members’ input on results achieved as part of evaluating progress on EPA’s environmental
justice responsibilities and objectives from community groups. Such audits and reports are no
substitute for action, but action is unlikely to happen unless EPA commits to and also has an
independent evaluation of whether it is indeed following through, and has accomplished real
results for communities, that the communities themselves realize as progress on environmental
health and environmental justice.
       In addition, Commenters also urge EPA to implement NEJAC’s recommendations on
permitting and a long list of other issues – including recommendations submitted as part of Plan
EJ2014 that have not been implemented. 58

        11.      Identify additional mobile source regulatory measures to protect
                 disproportionately impacted communities.
        Evidence suggests low-income and minority populations disproportionately reside near
heavily trafficked roadways, and thus face greater exposure to traffic-related air pollution. 59
These concerns can be even more pronounced in communities adjacent to freight hubs (e.g.,
railyards, distribution centers, ports). While some pollution issues can be addressed through
better zoning, it is imperative to do more to protect communities currently facing the health
threats from transportation-related pollution. Thus, we recommend that EPA explore additional
regulations and guidance to ensure transportation-related pollution is cleaned up in communities,
including measures to clean up freight equipment.

III.    INTERAGENCY WORK
        States: EPA must strengthen oversight of state and local agencies administering federal
environmental laws and using delegated authority to issue permits, lead enforcement, and take
other actions. Many permitting and enforcement decisions are made at the state and local levels.
Without stronger EPA oversight, communities have not been afforded the full protection that
national standards and federal regulations are supposed to provide. As part of Plan EJ2020, EPA
should prioritize state and local oversight to lift up the best practices in some states and local
areas in permitting, rulemaking, and enforcement, and to end the worst practices in areas where
communities feel completely alone in handling serious environmental and health concerns. EPA

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              100
 must use its full authority, including disapproving state programs or withdrawing delegation,
whenever necessary to ensure that communities do not lose the basic protections federal
environmental laws are supposed to provide. In addition, EPA should help make up the gap
where state and local government agencies and laws, such as a lack of appropriate zoning or a
history of discriminatory zoning, create particular concerns for communities of color and low-
income communities.
         Under the Clean Water Act, for years communities in Appalachia have faced state
refusals to implement basic requirements to assure water quality, including the mandate to
translate narrative water quality standards into permit effluent limitations. EPA has documented
many of these problems and the fact that the impacts of these inadequate and unlawful permits
fall disproportionately on low-income communities in multiple documents, including reports and
guidance. 60 Yet, EPA still has not exercised the full oversight and authority needed to end this
problem – while communities which are disproportionately low-income continue to suffer from
the years of devastation to waters, wildlife, and public health associated with mountaintop
removal mining. 61
      Longstanding problems with Texas’s air permitting programs provide well-known
examples that EPA must address there and in other states, and on which EPA has received
comments in recent years. 62
         As another example, many parts of the country are currently facing potential increases in
use of oil and gas transportation and infrastructure developments located in close proximity to
communities with significant environmental justice concerns. For example, in Albany, New
York, Global Companies offloads crude oil from rail cars into storage tanks and then transfers
the oil to ships and barges on the Hudson River. Recent permitting actions by the New York

 State Department of Environmental Conservation (“DEC”) have significantly increased rail and
barge traffic and increased air emissions at the terminal, placing residents of the Ezra Prentice
Homes at risk, yet DEC initially failed to conduct an appropriate environmental review of the
project and failed to follow the required procedures for projects that could impact environmental
justice communities. This is also a serious problem in other parts of the country, and we also
highlight as an example the report from California on “blast zone” crude transport issues
impacting communities of color. 63
         Another example is North Carolina’s failure to address the impacts of industrial animal
product in eastern North Carolina, where the density of hog and, more recently, poultry
operations in low-income African American, Latino, and Native American communities has
affected quality of life, waterways, and a range of health indicators. For years, community
members in eastern North Carolina complained to EPA and the state Department of Environment
and Natural Resources about the adverse effects of the industry on their health and environment
and implored the agencies to provide greater protection to no avail. In 2014 community groups
filed a civil rights complaint with EPA pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which might have been avoided had the state and EPA taken action to resolve the problem.
        Federal: Under the Federal Interagency Working group, EPA should continue to work
with other agencies and White House Offices to advance environmental justice, including
through achieving results for the identified hot spot communities and areas with environmental
justice concerns, as discussed earlier. Federal agencies, especially HHS, including the CDC,
NIEHS, should work to assure better data is collected and available on health status and health
concerns at the census tract level. These data are important for communities and EPA staff to
have to direct and assess the success of resources applied to promote environmental justice. In
addition, commenters are aware that some agencies (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) appear
to have no environmental justice office or clear objectives of any kind. EPA should assist all
agencies in implementing the Executive Order. For example, EPA should provide guidance to
HUD and other agencies to consider when spending public funds, such as on low-income
housing, which should be built in healthy and environmentally accessible areas – and not next to
refineries, power plants, or other industrial sources of air and water pollution. As another
example, EPA should ensure other federal agencies are vigilant in monitoring transportation
projects, including freight expansion projects, which can exact a large toll on communities.

IV.     EPA SHOULD BUILD TITLE VI COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT INTO
        ALL ASPECTS OF AGENCY OPERATIONS AND INCLUDE TITLE VI
        ACTION ITEMS IN PLAN EJ2020.
      EPA has separated Title VI enforcement from its Plan EJ2020 process. Commenters urge
EPA to set Title VI commitments as part of Plan EJ2020 for the following reasons.

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                 102
         Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d – 2000d-7,
prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of race, color
or national origin in any of their programs or activities. EPA, like other federal agencies,
enacted regulations pursuant to Title VI. 40 C.F.R. Part 7. Title VI and its regulations prohibit
intentional forms of discrimination as well as actions, policies, and practices with unjustified
discriminatory impacts, regardless of intent. In 2001, the Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v.
Sandoval that aggrieved persons have no private right of action to enforce Title VI unless they
can demonstrate intent. 64 As a result, people living in environmental justice communities that
are environmentally overburdened with toxic releases rely on EPA to require compliance and
enforce the law. Without an effective Title VI compliance and enforcement program at EPA, the
law is an empty vessel. Unfortunately, EPA’s Title VI program has been notoriously
inadequate. 65
         The Plan EJ2020 Action Agenda Framework again relegates EPA’s external civil rights
compliance and enforcement program to consideration on another day. Although we support the
development of a long-term OCR Strategic Plan, Plan EJ2020 should recognize that Title VI of
the Civil Rights of 1964 is one of the cornerstone legal tools for addressing issues of
environmental justice 66 and build specific action items for Title VI compliance and enforcement
into all aspects of EPA’s operations, especially as they relate to permits, delegation of authority,
enforcement, and program approvals. 67
        Relegating Title VI compliance and enforcement to later and separate treatment replicates
the mistake made when Plan EJ 2014 failed to provide detail on actions to improve its civil rights
program and ultimately released “Draft Supplement: Advancing Environmental Justice Through
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.” If, indeed, EPA is committed to improving its civil rights
program and recognizing that enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is an
important tool in EPA’s efforts to address discrimination and advance environmental justice, the
Plan EJ2020 Action Agenda must include a strong and coordinated approach that identifies
goals, actions, and metrics to assess performance and to send a clear message to EPA staff and
stakeholders. Specifically, the Plan EJ2020 Action Agenda should address the following issues:

    Notably, the audit conducted by Deloitte to assess EPA’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) specifically
criticized EPA for operating OCR in “an insular fashion” that limited its effectiveness and for failing to
provide clarity regarding internally or externally regarding expectations. Deloitte, Evaluation of the EPA
Office of Civil Rights at 2, supra n.65. Failing again to address these issues in the Plan EJ2020 Action
Agenda misses yet another opportunity to address these concerns.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                   103
              •   Process: EPA must review and modify policies and practices governing
                 communications with complainants and community-based stakeholders in the
                 Title VI enforcement process, both to ensure a more active role for complainants
                 and community-based stakeholders in the enforcement process and to bring Title
                 VI enforcement into line with environmental justice principles and EPA efforts to
                 encourage “meaningful engagement” of overburdened communities in permitting
                 and other decision-making. Although completion of the policy paper “Roles of
                 Complainants and Recipients in the Title VI Complaints and Resolution Process”
                 is a step forward, the Plan EJ2020 Action Agenda should include specific goals,
                 activities, and metrics to ensure changes in practice, including, for example,
                 training for EPA staff and reform of policies that limit interactions of staff with
                 stakeholders.

             •   Transparency: EPA still fails to make up-to-date information about Title VI
                 enforcement readily available, including, for example, a docket with links to
                 complaints, resolution agreements, and other official documents on EPA’s
                 website. Although this project is underway, the EJ2020 Action Plan should
                 include goals, activities and metrics to ensure that this project crosses the finish
                 line and then is maintained, reviewed, and improved over time.

             •   Strengthen Compliance: EPA should strengthen its pre-award and post-award
                 compliance review programs, including the collection and review of relevant
                 information. EPA has recently modified Form 4700-4, Preaward Compliance
                 Review Report For All Applicants and Recipients Requesting Federal Financial
                 Assistance, to determine whether applicants for federal financial assistance are
                 developing programs and activities on a non-discriminatory basis. Form 4700-4
                 is a start, but is insufficient to ensure compliance with Title VI. EPA should
                 require recipients of federal financial assistance to submit a detailed analysis of
                 how it complies with Title VI and EPA’s implementing regulations. State
                 environmental agencies that receive funding from EPA, for example, should
                 provide detailed information on how the agency’s permitting, enforcement, and
                 rulemaking requirements comply. Such documents should be made publicly
                 available for input, and should be reviewed by EPA as part of pre-award and post-
                 award compliance reviews.

             •   Legal Standards: EPA’s second policy paper, “Adversity and Compliance with
                 Environmental Health Based Thresholds,” 68 is languishing. Providing clarity on
                 the standard for determining adversity in a disparate impact case is a necessary
                 though insufficient step toward revision and finalization of guidance on legal
                 standards. The EJ2020 Action Plan should provide a clear and measurable path
                 forward to removing the “rebuttable presumption” that compliance with health
                 standards is a sufficient defense against a civil rights claim and resolving other

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                 104
                  uncertainties around the applicable standards by finalizing improved guidance
                 documents.

             •   The Backlog: The EJ 2020 Action Plan should establish activities and a timeline
                 by which EPA will resolve all pending Title VI civil rights complaints in a timely
                 way – with the involvement of complainants and their attorneys and with creative
                 and careful attention to the underlying issues. It is unconscionable that
                 complaints have been languishing with the Office of Civil Rights, in some cases
                 for more than a decade, reinforcing concerns about the integrity of the process.
                 Given EPA’s breach of responsibility and the delay experienced by complainants
                 seeking justice, the agency has a duty not just to complete the investigations, but
                 to address claims raised in the complaints.

             •   Capacity & Infrastructure: The EJ 2020 Action Plan should ensure that the
                 organizational dynamics and challenges outlined in the Deloitte report are fully
                 addressed and contain clear goals, activities and metrics to ensure that scarce
                 agency resources are preserved at all stages of civil rights compliance and
                 enforcement work.

             •   Coordination: The EJ 2020 Action Plan must set forth goals, activities and
                 metrics for EPA’s role in coordinating Title VI compliance and enforcement with
                 delegated programs, EPA’s regional programs, and other federal agencies.
                 Among other things, EPA must ensure that states submit Title VI plans on an
                 annual basis and should require that funding recipients submit Title VI plans for
                 review.

             •   Resolution and Remedies: The EJ 2020 Action Plan must include specific goals,
                 activities and metrics for reform of its practice to ensure that (a) the alternative
                 dispute resolution program provides sufficient technical assistance to level the
                 playing field for complainants, and (b) when EPA enters a voluntary compliance
                 agreement, remedial measures protect communities and secure Title VI
                 compliance.
        Finally, the EJ2020 Action Plan must ensure compliance and enforcement of the
prohibition against national origin discrimination affecting LEP persons. Among other things, to
comply with the Department of Justice’s Title VI requirements pursuant to Executive Order
13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” EPA must
finalize its internal LEP plan, and ensure the inclusion of native and indigenous languages as
discussed above. 69

   See LEP.gov, Executive Order 13166, http://www.lep.gov/13166/eo13166.html (“The Executive Order
requires Federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those
with limited English proficiency (LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so
LEP persons can have meaningful access to them. It is expected that agency plans will provide for such
meaningful access consistent with, and without unduly burdening, the fundamental mission of the agency.

Subject:                         EJ 2020 Comments


Dear EPA,

I am glad to hear that a new action framework for implementation by 2020 is being drafted. There are a few
suggestions I'd like to offer for consideration.

I noticed that in researching distressed environmental communities a significant problem is contaminated and
barren landscapes. Part of the initiative could serve to plant more greenery, especially trees, in areas that may
have been destroyed under construction projects. This would prove helpful in replacing old infrastructure with
restored woodlands or at least planting on unused land (I am thinking of the quarries and dirty streams in the
background of Cynthia Giles' video).

As for contaminated land and water, either direct funding of cleanup or an incentive for the community to help
clean them would allow the ecosystem to revive itself and it would benefit everyone there. I am from Syracuse,
where I would often run on the Onondaga Lakefront for sports training. While the lake is not completely clean,
Superfund cleanup of over $1 billion, with the help of Syracuse University and ESF technologies, has brought
fishing and possibly swimming back to ""America's Most Polluted Lake"". So either another round of Superfund
treatments could help the most distressed ecosystems, or perhaps finding ways for local industry to owe up to
their dumping and help restore the local environment would also provide financial backing of the most
overburdened toxic sites.

As environmental history dating back as far as the 1970s shows, local environmental policy can make just as
big an impact on the community as Federal oversight. I would encourage you to bring to justice perhaps on a
regional level those industries, especially non-renewable energy, if they have in any way disrupted the
surrounding ecosystem. The citizens of America will help by being educated on the effects of such
development as natural gas on the environment (fortunately, New York has a moratorium placed on this
practice so far). If they can stand unwavering with your help, then prevention of further environmental damage
may be possible and can become a standard for generations to come. As for local phenomenon like the
Californian drought, alternative solutions must be assessed quickly. William Shatner has proposed funding for
piping water from elsewhere, and while desalinization plants are expensive, perhaps a new contest to find the
most creative ways of supplying water to the parched valleys will help. Not even the most creative, but any
new developments could be considered in a world that has an iota of precious fresh water. Google and IEEE
has hosted over the past few years a contest to design a smaller electrical inverter for homes. Crowdfunding
and crowdsourcing may be the answer to some dire problems with climate change.

To prevent going on forever in detail about environmental policy, I will conclude that EJ Tools and EJSCREEN
should be continued, as well as perhaps a mobile app or online service to better feed environmental issue
updates to the public. Relevant environmental information for current hot topics (such as the California
drought, Keystone Pipeline XL, etc.) will help keep the public informed on topics that they may be directly
influenced by. I would hope technology can serve the country, and even the globe, to be a more cohesive
community in sustainability and preservation. Keeping science away from political bias may be a constant
fight, but the EPA has faced this adversity before and can be a major player in environmental balance,
environmental justice.

                                                               1

 Thank you for taking the time to get public feedback about EJ 2020: it truly makes a government by the people,
for the people.

Subject:                         Comment on EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework


To whom it may concern,

I am making a last minute comment on the EJ Action Agenda to say that our Community of Kenmore, Washington, which
is on the north end of Lake Washington, has experienced and is still experiencing environmental INJUSTICE because I can
not figure out how to stop the injustice. We are overrun with toxins that are not being tested and yet we know they are
there. We visited the EPA in DC in July 2014 and we met with our lawmakers. We were vindicated by Army Corps tests
which confirmed that the toxins are too high for open water disposal, and yet the transportation needs of the state and
polluters' businesses trump the concerns of citizens hoping for environmental justice.

I do not know the answer, but we need somebody who has enough intelligence and enough willingness to fight the
agencies and the rich companies that build bridges, the SR 520 Floating Bridge, for example. We didn't have lobbyists,
but the concrete company did/does.

Really what we need is money to right the wrong. We shouldn't have had our environment harmed, but I assume the
powers that be assessed the population and decided we were fractionated, and not quite rich enough to fight for
environmental health and scrutiny. We didn't even have the proper laws respected in 2011 when our politicians decided
to industrialize our north end of Lake Washington. The rich worked with the agencies and city in some way that
circumvented the laws meant to protect. The people complained to no avail.

I don't know what to tell you, except that I would welcome you to make part of your plan the STORY OF KENMORE, our
GOVERNOR, our CITY STAFF, our Citizens, our Leaders (or lack thereof, as I feel, as President of our nonprofit, that I have
failed the ecology of Lake Washington). I needed the media and support. I got dabbles of it, but it is too scary to fight
the city and do it as a volunteer. We have tried, we still are trying. If EPA had a way to tell this story, maybe we'd have
the heart to write it down, because you could make an example of kenmore and the floating bridge, and the politics that
caused this. Down the road by 2020 or a bit further, we'll probably see what diseases, if any, are caused by the dioxins. I
hope I'm wrong, but I fear there will be illnesses, unless we are successful and finally figure out a way to have this area
be a superfund site.

It would help if you could tell our stories and help us achieve the health of our environment. Have a fund to visit our site
and meet the people and help us negotiate with the Cemex and Calportland and city and state and WSDOT so that this
never happens again to a suburb of Seattle where there are ESA listed species but the transportation giants planned to
use the ecology to build bridges, game the system, and pull the wool over the eyes of a disorganized community.

I still hope for success, but I see money is what guides the success.

That is unfortunate.

I think you'd have to fund a lobbyist to help the nonprofits, like ours, People for an Environmentally Responsible
Kenmore. That might help. Maybe I should have learned to write grants, but to be honest, the grant writing just doesn't
work. It takes too long.

What we need is a citizen led third party right to test comprehensively in the lake, to find the source of the toxins and
stop the barges which are causing our area to be full of asphalt and concrete. We are not supposed to be an
underprivileged community. We are a suburb, the ""drive by city"" that links the best and the brightest of places like
                                                              1
            EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              111
 Redmond where Microsoft is with the City of Seattle. Basically, the sad thing is that a bedroom community was taken
advantage of. Its ecology was used to make a bridge. It shouldn't have happened. We reached out to EPA, but we
haven't had success. Why? I don't know. I wish I did. I will listen if you write or call.

For your agency to do its work, you need to help us write this story of Kenmore, on the shores of Lake Washington,
where the system error included a shovel ready, barge‐ready project to build a bridge in an area where there were and
are dioxins, but they did it anyway, they barged and moved around the toxins without regard to the public health and
safety and they are still doing the barging and still wanting to ignore the fact that the source of the dioxins should be
found before more work continues.

That is what should happen for Environmental Justice, but we grow weary having asked and fought since 2011.

Add what we need to your plan, please.

Thank you.
EIizabeth Mooney

 ECOS Letter to EPA on EJ2020 draft Framework
July 14, 2015
Page 2 of 5

We also recommend that the final Framework reflect a commitment to continuous improvement. The
Agency and many states have made commitments to evaluate key processes and approaches to identify
ways to make them more effective and efficient. EPA’s final Framework to advance environmental
justice should integrate continuous improvement principles.

Please note, ECOS’ input does not supersede or alter the comments or opinions of any individual state,
as state perspectives and approaches may vary on different aspects of the draft Framework.

Specific Input on the draft Framework

I. Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and environment
   of overburdened communities

    A. Incorporate environmental justice in rulemaking

The Agency has developed a guidance document on how to incorporate EJ into its own rulemaking
efforts, which should be referenced here unless another guidance is contemplated.2 The final Framework
must make clear that this goal refers to EPA rulemaking, as states have their own processes for
considering environmental justice issues in their own rule development and related activities.

    B. Consider environmental justice in EPA permitting

Here, the draft Framework makes clear that the Agency is referring to its own permitting processes.
ECOS members are already serving as resources to EPA on how states have found ways to meaningfully
incorporate EJ issues into the permitting process. These processes have been documented in a number of
ways.3 States are supportive of EPA’s commitment and efforts to incorporate EJ into its permitting
activities and appreciate EPA’s intention to enable overburdened communities to have full and
meaningful access to the permitting process and to develop permits that address EJ issues to the greatest
extent practicable.

Public participation is one of the cornerstones of EJ and many states have made public participation a
priority for their Agencies and/or implemented their own approaches to consider EJ in permitting
through policy, guidance or statutes. Some states have made significant progress in meaningful
involvement of overburdened communities and continue to focus on communicating, collaborating and
addressing issues presented by these communities.

States value public interests and concerns, and are working directly with stakeholders in communities to
provide public involvement. We support the current efforts made to develop and implement regional
plans that describe how and when regional offices will engage in enhanced outreach to overburdened
communities for EPA-issued permits.

    C. Advance environmental justice through compliance and enforcement

Since states bring a significant portion (figures range to near 90 percent) of compliance and enforcement
actions, this portion of the draft Framework must also specify that EPA is referring only to its
compliance and enforcement efforts, and not those of state environmental agencies. There can be much
overlap between EPA’s chosen compliance and enforcement cases and state activities. Thus, in this part
of the final Framework, we encourage EPA to specify that it will work closely with states in the
compliance and enforcement area on opportunities to leverage limited resources through coordinated
efforts in identified communities. EPA also should note that it will consult with state environmental
agencies and other stakeholders to identify overburdened communities, as states and community
organizations may in many cases already have done the groundwork to make such identifications.

    D. Enhance science tools for considering environmental justice in decision-making

ECOS recommends that in the final Framework this provision refer to “science and other” tools for
considering EJ in decision-making. We recommend that EPA add language to refer to “decision-making
and other analyses.” EPA has developed a number of resources, some of which are science-based tools,
some of which are decisional tools, and some of which are screening tools (e.g., EJSCREEN).

We also urge the final Framework to discuss in this section how EPA will coordinate with states on
setting research priorities and on training on the various tools, so that states can obtain the most benefit
from them and consider how the tools interact with one another. States request that they be a part of the
development process of new EJ tools so that the learning and knowledge curve is less steep and tool
development may leverage state experiences. EPA’s final Framework must make clear that states’ use of
EJSCREEN and any other EJ tools is optional. EPA also should note that not all tools are appropriate
for all settings (e.g., not all tools work in urban and rural areas).

ECOS suggests that the final Framework state that EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD)
will continue its collaboration with the Environmental Research Institute of the States (ERIS) to obtain
input on the types of new tools that would be helpful with states, and to obtain state input on science-
based tools.

II. Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened communities

As noted above, states are already working closely with communities facing a variety of environmental,
socioeconomic, and health challenges. Addressing the needs of these communities is often not the
exclusive purview of the environmental regulator. Accordingly, we recommend that in the final
Framework, EPA acknowledge that the definition of an “overburdened community” will vary from place
to place, and that the Agency will work with states, other federal agencies (see next point), and local
partners to identify these communities.



        EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                          115
 ECOS Letter to EPA on EJ2020 draft Framework
July 14, 2015
Page 4 of 5

The federal definition of “overburdened community” articulated in Plan EJ 2014 is broad and provides
good guidance for states,4 but in some states overburdened communities may fall outside this definition.5

    A. Collaborate with states, tribes, local governments and other co-regulators to share and develop
       environmental justice tools and practices

ECOS supports this draft Framework goal. It is well-drafted to put a focus on the joint nature of
training, sharing, and tool development. ECOS appreciates the reference in the draft Framework to E-
Enterprise for the Environment, which embodies a joint governance approach to decision-making so
frequently referenced herein. States are pleased to see the reference to local governments, as some
decisions of concern to communities are the result of local government authority and choices, and not
within EPA or state agency jurisdiction.

    B. Work with other federal agencies to advance environmental justice through the Interagency
       Working Group on Environmental Justice

ECOS supports this element of the draft Framework as it encourages important cross-federal agency
coordination on EJ issues. Environmental regulators are unlikely to be the sole source of support for
overburdened communities. Coordination with education, housing, energy, disaster response and
emergency preparedness, and other federal agencies will be critical to developing the most effective
approaches to directing resources to communities in need.

Notably, this portion of the draft Framework mentions for the first time collaboration with the business
and industrial sectors. ECOS encourages other portions of the final Framework also to reference the
important, proactive role of business and industry to reduce impacts on overburdened communities and
to help EPA and states achieve EJ goals.

III. Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities

This portion of the draft Framework discusses measurement and metrics, and also calls for the possible
identification of national programmatic efforts. ECOS appreciates that EPA plans to work with states
and others to develop these measures and programs, and urges that such language be retained and
emphasized in the final Framework.

IV. Related efforts: Climate and Title VI

The two “related efforts” listed in the draft Framework - climate and Title VI – appear out of place at the
end of the document. There are many related efforts that address the needs of overburdened
communities beyond these culled out, including those in the areas of drinking water protection, sewer
overflow reduction, toxics and pesticide control, and waste management – just to name a few.

The two short points also do not provide any context for the extensive activity ongoing in these areas.
For example, ECOS has been working on Title VI issues for many years, from submitting comments to
the state-EPA Title VI Compliance Workgroup, and has provided input to the Office of Civil Rights on
the strategic plan it is developing. ECOS is working on resilience and adaptation efforts with other parts
of the Agency.

ECOS recommends EPA delete the “related efforts” from the final Framework.

Conclusion

ECOS appreciates the opportunity to provide input to the Agency on the draft Framework. Please do not
hesitate to contact me to follow up on any of our points at adunn@ecos.org or 202-266-4929. We look
forward to further conversation with you and to seeing the final Framework.

Attention: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
Re: Comments on EPA’s Draft Framework for the EJ 2020 Action Agenda (EJ 2020)
    I.       INTRODUCTION
         Environmental Defense Fund (“EDF”) appreciates the opportunity to comment on EPA’s
draft framework for the EJ 2020 Action Agenda (April 15, 2015) (“EJ 2020”). EDF is a non-
partisan environmental organization with more than 750,000 members nationwide. EDF is
dedicated to working toward innovative, cost-effective solutions to environmental problems,
building on a foundation of rigorous science, economics, and law. We comment on EJ 2020 as
an environmental justice stakeholder whose work impacts overburdened communities and who
partners with environmental justice organizations on overlapping issues. Environmental justice
is at the core of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment. Many
communities that face high risk of exposure to harmful pollutants are disadvantaged and
underserved. These communities look to EPA for protection through information on
environmental risks, enforcement of environmental laws, cooperation with state and federal
agencies, rulemakings and permitting sensitive to environmental justice concerns, and the
development of programs to address pollution. EPA has made progress in ensuring that families
across the country have access to clean water, clean air, and a healthy environment. However,
many communities are still overburdened and much remains to be done.
        EDF welcomes EJ 2020 as a starting point for the agency in advancing EPA goals of
driving visible differences in communities. The framework includes important elements such as
promoting collaboration across federal agencies and enhancing scientific tools for considering
environmental justice in decision-making. Given the urgent need for full protection of human
health and environment across the country, we respectfully urge EPA to strengthen the
framework. In particular, we ask the agency to better incorporate environmental justice in
federal advisory committees, elevate port and goods movement issues as a national priority,
consider environmental justice in voluntary programs administered by the agency, advance
science related to environmental justice priorities, and set clear benchmarks and goals for
measuring progress on environmental justice issues. We offer the following specific comments
on EJ 2020.


EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                     118
     II.      INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES,
             SUBCOMMITTEES, AND WORKGROUPS


         Federal advisory committees and their subcommittees/workgroups play an integral role in
advising and guiding EPA on critical matters in science and policy. A diverse array of experts
lend their time and knowledge to advancing EPA’s mission and while some have deep expertise
in environmental justice, there is no institutional mechanism to ensure representation of
environmental justice perspectives in federal advisory committees. We propose developing a
stronger linkage between federal advisory committees and environmental justice participation.
Examples of federal advisory committee subcommittees and workgroups that do address key
environmental justice issues without a formalized mechanism for incorporating environmental
justice include:

                The Ports Workgroup under the Mobile Source Technical Review Subcommittee
                 (MSTRS). Ports and goods movement issues are a key environmental justice
                 issue and this workgroup is charged with providing recommendations to MSTRS
                 on how EPA can develop and implement a voluntary initiative to improve port
                 environmental performance and air quality for port communities.

                The Air Toxics Workgroup under the Clean Air Act Advisory Council (CAAAC).
                 Environmental justice communities often face high levels of air toxics and this
                 workgroup is charged with providing guidance to CAAAC on strategies to reduce
                 air toxic emissions and reduce risk in communities.

                The Science Advisory Board’s review of EPA’s Draft Technical Guidance for
                 Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis.

       Many federal advisory committees and their subcommittees/workgroups address issues
with environmental justice implications, but may not have explicit mechanisms for incorporating
environmental justice concerns. In order to fully address environmental justice challenges
associated with these issues, however, these workgroups may benefit from EPA guidance on
how to better incorporate environmental justice perspectives.

       We propose a stronger and more direct linkage between federal advisory committees and
environmental justice issues and EDF urges EPA to include a federal advisory committee
element under Section 1 of EJ 2020. We believe that EPA is best suited to determine the exact
mechanism for incorporating environmental justice in the federal advisory committee process.

    III.     ELEVATE PORT AND GOODS MOVEMENT ISSUES AS A NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
             JUSTICE PRIORITY

       Communities at the fenceline of ports and goods movement corridors face a multitude of
mobile and stationary emissions sources. They also often face challenges with noise, congestion,
land use, and water quality and are typically underserved. EPA has estimated that at least 13



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       119
 million people live close to marine ports and rail yards and are exposed to diesel pollution. This
includes a disproportionate number of low-income households, African-Americans, and
Hispanics1. Diesel pollution is linked to a number of diseases including asthma and lung cancer.
EDF agrees with EPA that ports are a serious environmental justice concern and that much more
needs to be done to protect the health and environment of port communities.
         Although EPA regulates individual sectors of mobile sources, heavy-duty truck engine
tiers for example, the regulatory authority over port areas is limited compared to stationary
sources. EPA has advanced a National Ports Initiative that seeks to identify how EPA can
reduce emissions at ports through a voluntary public-private program. Given the environmental
justice characteristics of many communities near port areas, the complexity of the sector, and the
known health implications of diesel pollution, port and goods movement issues should be
considered by EPA to be a national environmental justice priority.
    IV.      CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN VOLUNTARY EPA PROGRAMS
         EJ 2020 strengthens environmental justice as part of EPA’s regulatory capacity, including
rulemaking and permitting, but lacks emphasizing environmental justice in the context of EPA’s
voluntary programs. Non-regulatory efforts are an important part of EPA’s work as they
leverage industry partners, state agencies, and non-traditional stakeholders in sectors where EPA
may otherwise have limited engagement. Including a more formal mechanism by which
environmental justice is considered in voluntary programs will help ensure that environmental
justice isn’t limited to EPA’s regulatory authority, but carried through to the numerous voluntary
programs that have been successful in improving environmental outcomes.
       Ports and goods movement is an example of a sector that has strong connections to
environmental justice priorities and is being addressed from a voluntary framework through the
National Ports Initiative. This effort could serve as a model on how to strengthen the
consideration of environmental justice issues in the development of voluntary programs.
        As an example of an opportunity, environmental justice considerations could be more
robust within the SmartWay Program, which is a successful public-private program to improve
the environmental performance of the goods movement supply chain. Communities near the
fenceline of goods movement corridors often face environmental justice challenges and the
SmartWay Program could include environmental justice considerations that result in benefits for
communities, EPA, and industry. One idea is to add a community leadership award component
for program partners that go above and beyond the traditional SmartWay requirements. This
emphasizes the voluntary nature of the program while promoting community partnerships.
        Voluntary programs are an important tool for EPA and represent an opportunity to
deepen the agency’s environmental justice practice. EDF urges EPA to include a voluntary
program element under Section 1 of EJ 2020. Strengthening environmental justice elements in
voluntary programs may include communicating environmental justice results, considering
environmental justice issues in program design, or developing advisory mechanisms with
environmental justice leaders.

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                         120
        V.      SET BENCHMARKS FOR MEASURING PROGRESS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
       EDF appreciates the inclusion of Plan EJ 2014 Commitments/Accomplishments in the EJ
2020 framework. The public assessment of EPA’s progress on Plan EJ 2014 promotes
transparency, accountability, and confidence in the agency and demonstrates that some progress
has been made. This model should be expanded for EJ 2020 and EDF encourages EPA to set
measurable benchmarks on environmental justice issues. Benchmarks will help drive
commitments within and outside the agency and help define which areas are making progress
and which areas may need additional support.
       Benchmarking is common among private and public sectors and is increasingly seen as a
necessary tool in establishing actionable goals, assessing progress toward those goals, and
communicating results. EPA’s current method of tracking commitments and listing
accomplishments is a first step and EJ 2020 is an opportunity to develop more robust
benchmarks that fully demonstrate EPA’s commitment and leadership on environmental justice.
This includes identifying specific actions and strengthening overall accountability.
       VI.     ADVANCING SCIENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PRIORITIES
        Cumulative impact research and citizen science are two tools that have been growing in
importance and relevance for environmental justice. EPA has made efforts to more fully develop
these two areas and EDF welcomes this work2. Improving the understanding of cumulative
impacts is critical for a more complete assessment of the health impacts facing communities.
EPA can play a lead role in utilizing cumulative impact research when it is available and in
helping to advance the viability of this research.
        Citizen science can empower community members and contribute valuable data in areas
where data collection may otherwise be difficult. EPA can help foster citizen science by
providing additional guidance on how it can be used to pursue environmental justice tactics, such
as intervening in permitting, and by showcasing best-practice models of effective citizen science.
       VII.    CONCLUSION
        EDF appreciates EPA’s efforts in developing a draft framework for the EJ 2020 Action
Agenda. The framework will enable EPA to further address deep-rooted environmental justice
challenges. However, we believe that more must be done to ensure that overburdened and
underserved communities are fully protected. EDF recommends strengthening EJ 2020 by
incorporating environmental justice in federal advisory committees, prioritizing port
environmental justice issues, including environmental justice concerns in EPA’s voluntary
programs, better utilizing scientific tools for environmental justice priorities, and setting
measurable benchmarks to assess EPA’s performance on environmental justice issues. These five
actions will ultimately contribute to EPA’s goals of more fully integrating environmental justice
across the agency and making a visible difference in overburdened communities.

Hello,

I have spoken to some of the leadership and presented my suggestions summarized below:

               The leadership should coordinate more conversations with state and local governments regarding what EJ is and
                looks like on the ground, help to develop capacity and integrate EJ principles within policy.
               I would like to see a push for inter‐departmental collaborations within local government infusing EJ in policies,
                the way work is done using the federal government model
               Highlight successful local programs to leverage more local support
               EPA can engage small businesses with compliance assistance as a separate activity and lay the foundation for

Dear Mr. Charles Lee:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework proposed by the
Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) on April 15, 2015. The Environmental Justice Leadership Forum on
Climate Change (EJ Forum) i is a national coalition of over 42 community based environmental justice organizations
representing 23 different states. The EJ Forum was formed in 2008 to mobilize and facilitate a national working group of
environmental justice leaders to catalyze and inform state and federal policy, help grassroots campaigns, provide a
unified, strong voice, and support political and legislative action that will result in the development of just policies and
mechanisms that equitably reduce carbon emissions in all communities.
Our Members have always and continue to be heavily engaged in permitting and rulemaking actions initiated by the
Agency to provide an environmental justice perspective that is often not sought or included in Agency actions. We
engage by offering public comments and testimony, serving on multiple federal advisory committees and providing our
“on-the-ground” expertise at various Agency sponsored workshops and meetings. Consequently, our recommendations
represent the concerns of a diverse set of communities across the country.
We appreciate your efforts to work into the proposed framework some of the specific comments offered by our individual
members that were raised in one-on-one meetings prior to the release of this document. In addition to those comments,
we have some additional thoughts about goals 1 & 3 outlined in the framework, and a diverse set of general
recommendations.
MAIN GOAL 1: DEEPEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PRACTICE WITHIN EPA PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH
AND ENVIRONMENT OF OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES


    •   EJ in rulemaking:
            o Require states, as a part of their planning process, to conduct an EJ analysis to ensure that equity
                 considerations are used to inform planning and make sure the path forward to compliance is
                 beneficial to all Peoples. This should not be an option, and states should be required to provide
                 additional engagement opportunities – beyond the one required meeting – with interested stakeholder and
                 community groups. While guidance from the Agency can be useful to State Agencies, having a mandate
                 in the final rule that requires an analysis be conducted can provide an impetus to move in that direction.
                 If states refuse, than EPA must complete the analysis. We have the right as Americans to life, liberty and
                 the pursuit of happiness. Without an environmental justice analysis and corresponding corrective rulings,
                 regulations and practices the right to life is seriously compromised and too often cut short. Statistics from
                 both the EPA, other federal agencies, and academia show that certain communities in proximity to
                 emission emitting facilities have greater health risks and higher incidences of death related to



        EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                   123
                environmental factors. We are talking about both a systemic change in policy making, as well as
               addressing our constitutional and human rights.
           o Enhance regional EJ coordinator engagement and accountability with state environmental
               agencies, particularly in the rule-making and other Agency action processes. Regional coordinators
               should be the connective tissue between community stakeholders and the state environmental process to
               ensure the proper public participation activities are happening. The Agency should strongly consider
               increasing the required amount of public engagement for rulemakings. While this might be seen as an
               extra burden, in most cases, 1 meeting at the State level to accommodate all stakeholders is insufficient,
               especially if true engagement is what the Agency desires.
           o Guidance generated with various rulemakings – both EJ and general guidance – should be
               promoted as a tool and integrated into the standard operating procedures, as well as Performance
               Partnership Agreements used by state and local environmental Agencies. Regional coordinators
               could help facilitate some of this knowledge transfer through meetings, conferences, webinars, etc. with
               local and state environmental partners.
    •   Enhance science tools for considering EJ in decision-making
           o Develop guidance on how citizen science and spiritual knowledge/expertise will be integrated and
               used by state environmental agencies to help implement policy, provide additional data for
               enforcement and compliance proceedings and to help create protective standards. The use of hand-
               held monitors and NextGen monitoring and other devices are improving and being used more frequently
               by stakeholders. The value of citizen data should not be overlooked or underestimated. Providing state
               agencies with direction as to how to use this additional data source is needed. Along these same lines,
               understanding how to incorporate the spiritual value of the earth and its resources and most prominently
               the knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and Native American Peoples, and how to incorporate that into the
               decision making process as an ‘added value’ to the scientific decision making process is critical as well.
           o Advancing cumulative impacts research into action is critical. While it is hard to reach the ‘perfect
               model’ or ‘perfect scientific methodology’ to quantify/qualify cumulative risk. To move us out of “we
               can’t do”, the Agency should start to utilize the frameworks/tools developed thus far, to create a process
               by which decision making (i.e. permitting) intentionally considers all major/minor, permitted, mobile, etc.
               sources of pollution. This goal needs to be more specific, and have an OWNER attached to it. (Possibly
               the Office of Research and Development) with specific tasks as a part of a workplan. The webinar series
               created by EPA staff is a great starting point in terms of documenting the progress.ii Now is the time to
               put some traction and move forward with ‘what we know’ versus focusing using on what we do not
               know.
           o In the Agency’s most recent 2014 Climate Change Indicators Report iii, it would be helpful to infuse
               EJ indicators into this next analysis. Possible ‘indicators’ from an EJ perspective could include
               utilizing the EJ Index from EJ SCREEN and looking at national trends (depending on how often the data
               is updated in this analytical tool), looking at emissions of GHG to air and how that has changed over time,
               compliance and enforcement related to emissions of climate forcers, as well as developing a measure of
               ‘climate resilience/readiness’ that could incorporate multiple media. It would be a great opportunity for
               the EJ Forum to provide some guidance as to what ‘indicators’ could be useful for the internal process.
MAIN GOAL 3: DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS ON OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES

•   An evaluation of the effectiveness of Agency programming needs to be undertaken. This type of evaluation can
    be useful in determining which programs have been impactful, should re-purposed or defunded. This evaluation
    should be internal and external. The internal process would include creating a mechanism by which the EPA and
    other Agencies in the federal family track/document – on an annual basis – how they have taken steps to integrate EJ
    into their practices, as well as monies that have been used to provide staff, assistance, etc., by program. This
    evaluation would be posted for public review, utilizing current reporting mechanisms (e.g., White House Council on



        EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                               124
     Environmental Quality or Agency accountability reports related to finance and planning. The external process could
    garner feedback from external stakeholders - from community organizations, NGOs, small businesses - as to the
    impact of certain Agency programs. Periodic evaluation can help inform how the Agency moves forward with
    program priorities. For example, the Urban Air Toxics Program and the CARE program that was independently
    evaluated and found to be a successful program that should be sustainediv. Currently, the CARE program is defunded.
    Creating an evaluation mechanism using indictors of progress, jointly developed between Agency personnel and
    community members. This mechanism should be transparent and updated on an annual basis, possibly coupled with
    the Agency Sustainability Scorecard that is submitted to the White House in February.
•   Delineating the responsible party and actions to track progress on the proposed framework is crucial. The
    Action Framework should have a specific effort attached to each statement. Will each of the statements have specific
    actions/tasks associated with it? For example, Under Goal 1, Section D, where it says “Advance research on
    cumulative risks and impacts”, it would be helpful to denote at least one specific action associated with advancing
    this work. It would also help to know who (which department, individual, etc.) will be responsible for moving
    forward with the identified efforts. Accountability and a point of contact is needed for community engagement.
•   Evaluate previous recommendations and implement them. There are numerous reports that have been generated
    by many of the advisory committees and boards to the EPA as it relates to environmental justice. Undergoing a
    structured scan and status of the recommendations related to environmental justice that have been proposed would be
    a useful piece of information. For example, we support many of the recommendations that have not been addressed
    in the recommendations submitted to the Agency from the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council on April
    29, 2011 in response to EJ Plan 2014 v. It is very important that we do not create too many new goals without
    addressed the goals that were already set forth.
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

•   Expanding the definition of environmental justice communities. The issue has been raised regarding how
    prisoners – defined as people held in prisons, jails, detention facilities, civil commitment centers and other facilities
    that hold people against their will as punishment or while awaiting court-related proceedings, i.e. trial, sentencing,
    deportation, etc. – are a community of concern that is being ignored. In some accounts, prisoners are confined to
    places that are not meeting environmental, health and safety standards, and, in some cases, environmental conditions
    that are within the facility and outside the facility, with some prisons being sited on former waste sites, flood plains
    and hazards. We encourage the Agency to start a dialogue on the EJ implications on prisoner populations and
    facilities.vi
•   Accountability and Structure.
         o There appears to be an obvious difference in the amount of time and effort spent to address and engage on
              environmental justice within the various Offices of the EPA. While the capacity of EJ organizations is
              limited to focusing federal advocacy on generally one media (i.e. air, water, waste), that should not preclude
              the Agency Offices from investing time and effort to insure that EJ is a high priority within that Office. We
              are charging the OEJ, and/or other higher ranking officials that report to the Administrator to develop a
              transparent method of oversight to insure that ALL offices are working to integrate EJ into the programming
              and planning. At the least, developing a system – or integrating into an existing system – efforts, outcomes
              for each Office – is critical.
         o Where feasible, every Federal Advisory Committee should be required to have an Environmental Subgroup
              as a part of structure to ensure that the recommendations from these bodies do not explicitly address EJ issues
              which cross various departments, sectors, and media.
•   Addressing Human Rights and Civil Rights.
         o Develop a strategy and workplan to address the backlog of complains relative to the Office of Civil Rights. A
              conversation, webinar, convening that includes community members to understand the challenges of this
              process, where it stands, how it can be used would be useful.




       EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                   125
           o    Develop a strategy/workplan about how to operationalize how a human rights framework - the human rights
               to life, health, and freedom from racial discrimination, self-determination, and meaningful participation in
               governmental decisions – into Agency priorities. A recent report discusses specific actions that are needed to
               address human rights, environmental justice and climate justice.vii
 •    Building capacity for communities. Enhance the funding that is available for technical assistance for communities
      for research, permitting and compliance assistance/research, etc.
 •    The monetization of costs and benefits on health and environmental factors needs to be integrated into the
      environmental justice discussion. A set of guidelines to address how the costs of inaction will impact environmental
      justice communities does not seem to be addressed anyway in the Plan. Looking specifically at the EPAs Office of
      Policy – Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analysis viii there is a section that addresses distributional costs and
      benefits for Environmental Justice. However, we would like to suggest that the cost of ‘inaction’ be included. Using
      health data and health cost data, based on specific actual and projected health outcomes, putting dollars and cents to
      substantiate the need for certain permitting and other decisions to be made is critical.
 We trust that you will strongly consider our suggestions and recommendations and we are willing to clarify our comments
 or work with you to flesh out some of the ideas presented. Again, thank you for the opportunity and we look forward to
 the EPA being the lead Agency to building sustainable communities and eliminating structures and processes that
 contribute to environmental racism. If you have any specific questions regarding these comments, please contact Dr.

          Public Comment re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

Dear Mr. Lee:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. The
Environmental Law & Policy Clinic is a​ joint project of Duke University’s Law School and the
Nicholas School of the Environment. O ​ n behalf of the Clinic, we would like to thank and
congratulate the US EPA for the agency’s enthusiastic commitment to the principles of
Environmental Justice. Your dedication and years of hard work are evident in Plan EJ 2014, its
associated work products and status reports. As a law clinic serving community organizations
that are often facing environmental injustices, our faculty, students, law fellows and clients have
had several opportunities to make use of the tools developed pursuant to Plan EJ 2014, including
EJSCREEN and ​EJ Legal Tools​. We are grateful for this opportunity to comment on the draft
framework for EJ 2020.

We address several points in these comments:
  1. Measurable results in overburdened communities should be the unifying goal of EJ 2020.
      We recommend that EPA use EJ 2020 as an opportunity to focus on implementation and
      results, rather than further planning, evaluation or tools development;

 EJ 2020 Draft Framework Comments                               Duke Environmental Law & Policy Clinic




    2. EPA can use a number of strategies to better engage states and other co­regulators in
       environmental justice, particularly with regards to permitting. In particular, we urge EPA
       to use the pending NC Division of Air Quality permit for Carolinas Cement Company as
       a test case; and
    3. EPA could dramatically improve accessibility of federal resources to support
       community­based efforts for organizations representing overburdened populations.


Implementation and Results
Throughout the EJ 2020 framework and associated materials, EPA repeatedly underscores
Administrator Gina McCarthy’s emphasis on making a “visible difference” in overburdened
communities, and rightly so. “Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened
communities” is the third goal listed under the EJ 2020 Draft Framework. Rather than a goal
               ​ easurable results in overburdened communities should be the single, unifying
third in line, m
goal of EJ 2020.

We strongly urge EPA to view EJ 2020 not as an aspirational strategy or a decision­making
framework, but as a work plan. Under Plan EJ 2014, the Agency has clearly defined
Environmental Justice and produced an impressive number of tools to assist agency staff in
better considering EJ in their actions. EJ 2020 is the Agency’s opportunity to actually put those
tools to good use, to ensure that in every EPA action environmental justice is not just being
considered, but put into action. Hallmarks of action would include timely investigation of citizen
complaints and requests for assistance.

The most important metric for evaluating the success of EPA’s efforts under EJ 2014 and EJ
2020 should be quantitative decreases in health­harming pollution in overburdened communities,
and ultimately falling rates of associated health endpoints in those communities. ​The evidence of
a “visible difference” where Americans are experiencing environmental injustice should be
measurably reduced pollution and associated illness.

Engaging states and other co­regulators in environmental justice
Perhaps the most promising area for EPA to start making a visible difference falls under Goal I,
“Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and
environment of overburdened communities.” Nearly every environmental permit issued is an
opportunity to do just that. EPA’s focus on considering environmental justice in EPA permitting
decisions is well­placed; however, only a tiny fraction of permits are actually issued by EPA​.
Most permits are issued by state agencies or tribal governments. Many of these permitting staffs
issued the very permits that created current Environmental Justice hotspots. It is not realistic to
                                                                                                   2

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           130

expect to correct problems at the same level of thinking that created the problems EPA now
seeks to solve. ​Environmental Justice will not be considered in most environmental permitting
decisions unless EPA strongly supports ­ or even compels ­ states to do so. ​We recommend four
strategies to advance the engagement of states in considering and implementing
environmental justice:

    ● Use peer­to­peer engagement to promote enhanced public participation

We strongly support EPA’s plans to continue to implement regional plans for enhanced public
participation. EPA’s ​Promising Practices​ is a useful tool for states and permit­seekers, and
should be actively promoted for state permitting decisions. We would like to see EPA partner
with businesses that have successfully used the strategies enumerated in ​Promising Practices​ for
peer­to­peer outreach and education with permit­seekers, targeting those seeking to site or
expand facilities in overburdened communities.

    ● Require Environmental Justice training for state agency staff members and leaders
      under cooperative agreements

EPA has completed mandatory training on Environmental Justice for all employees, according to
the Plan EJ 2020 Draft Action Agenda Framework. This is an excellent achievement! Many state
agency staff are in dire need of training on environmental justice as well. State agency
representatives in North Carolina, and presumably in many other states, are unclear about what
environmental justice is, why it is important, and how to consider or implement it in their jobs.
North Carolina serves as a key example here, as it no longer even has a coordinator for
Environmental Justice within the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. We
suggest that EPA require all state agency staff involved in permitting and enforcement to receive
mandatory environmental justice training under the terms of their cooperative agreements with
EPA. States like PA, CT and IL, which have shown leadership in implementing environmental
justice principles, could be tapped to help provide these trainings, so that the message is
peer­to­peer and thus more likely to be well­received by states. Such an approach would also
help meet EPA’s goal to “Collaborate with states, tribes, local governments and other
co­regulators to share and develop environmental justice tools and practices” (EJ 2020 Draft
Framework).

    ● Guide states to consider Environmental Justice and develop hooks that compel them
      to do so

 There are likely multiple barriers that prevent states from considering and implementing
 Environmental Justice in their permitting and regulatory functions. These barriers may include a
 lack of understanding of the principles of environmental justice (see previous bullet point), a

                                                                                                  3

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                          131

 perceived lack of resources or specialized knowledge to implement environmental justice,
 pressure from regulated entities to speed up regulatory processes in ways that could preclude
 full consideration of environmental justice, or others. EPA should identify and address these
 barriers through education and training, guidance materials, and by compelling states to
 consider Environmental Justice in permitting and enforcement whenever possible, such as under
 cooperative agreements or other funding mechanisms. For example, EPA could adapt the
 Agency’s guidance “Considering Environmental Justice in Permitting” for state use, and
 provide direct assistance in using such a tool. EPA could require states to make use of the
 guidance as a condition of specific funding / cooperative agreements.

    ● Use the Carolinas Cement Company air permit as a test case under EJ 2020 to move
      a state to thoroughly consider and implement environmental justice principles in a
      state permitting decision.

EPA has an excellent opportunity to help a state make considerable progress by learning
hands­on how to use the principles of Environmental Justice in permitting. In issuing a recent air
permit to Carolinas Cement Company, an endeavor that would build one of the world’s largest
cement plants in an over­burdened community on the Northeast Cape Fear River, North Carolina
regulators rejected the community’s many requests to consider environmental justice factors in
its permit (the Clinic served as legal counsel to one of many concerned community
organizations, PenderWatch and Conservancy, in submitting comments on the proposed permit
and making this request. Please see Appendix I for background information about this proposed
cement plant and our associated environmental justice concerns).

The NC DENR Division of Air Quality held a public hearing on the revised permit in 2013, at
which PenderWatch and several other community representatives urged the state to consider the
special vulnerabilities of a community on well water, already overburdened by legacy
contamination from present and historical polluters on the Northeast Cape Fear River. Despite
our specific requests to do so, the Division of Air Quality f​ latly refused​ to consider any
secondary impacts of the permit, from air deposition of mercury and heavy metals into an
impaired waterway, to the tremendous increases heavy truck traffic that would accompany the
opening of a massive cement plant. The hearing officer publicly belittled community members
for urging the Division of Air Quality to consider environmental justice in their permitting
decision. From the hearing officer’s written report:
        “Commenters appear to allege that the federal Environmental Justice policy
        applies to NC DAQ’s issuance of this permit. The federal policy, set forth in
        Federal Executive Order No. 12898, addresses the federal government’s
        responsibilities only, not the State’s. Therefore it is not applicable here.” ­ NC

        DENR Recommendation for Issuance of Air Quality Permit, Carolinas Cement
        Company, August 29, 2013 (see Appendix II).

The Carolinas Cement Company air permit was written by Donald Van der Vaart, who was has
since been appointed Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources.

We strongly urge EPA to conduct a thorough review of this permit and use your authority under
the Clean Air Act and other federal laws to give Environmental Justice its due consideration in
             ​ e would like to meet with you, Mr. Lee, as well as Mr. Mustafa Ali, to discuss
this matter. W

Improve accessibility of federal resources to support community­based efforts
for organizations representing overburdened populations
Several past and current clients of the Clinic have been EPA grantees under the Environmental
Justice Small Grants Program. We applaud EPA’s efforts to make federal resources available to
overburdened communities through grassroots organizations, and we have seen good outcomes
from the use of these resources on the ground here in North Carolina throughout the life of this
successful grant program. We also recognize that EPA has already made significant efforts to
make the EJ Small Grants Program in particular more navigable for community organizations,
and we sincerely appreciate those efforts.

However, this grants program still suffers from structural problems that can actually exacerbate
and promote the over­burdening of EJ communities, such as:
   ● Undue burden of paperwork disproportionate to the small amount of funding. The EJ
       Small Grants Program, capped at $30,000 per award, forces minimally­staffed
       community groups to use the same federal grant application and reporting system that a
       university with a professional grants management staff would use to apply for a grant
       worth millions;
   ● The Indirect Cost Rate forces an impossible choice between a too­low flat­rate overhead
       (10%) that fails to cover organizational costs, and a massive paperwork burden;
   ● The grant requires after­the­fact reimbursement for expenses, forcing perpetually
       under­funded organizations into cash flow crises. We have heard of staff at grantee
       organizations actually having to float grant expenses on their personal credit cards for
       months at a time ­ taking on interest charges personally ­ because of this system;
   ● Excessive reporting requirements out­of­proportion to the level of funding.




                                                                                                   5

Thus far, the approach that EPA has taken to improve the accessibility of these federal resources
has been to provide better training and support to prospective and current grantees in using the
federal grants system. EPA has also adopted a simplified Indirect Cost Rate option (the 10% flat
rate option). These are positive steps and we appreciate EPA’s consideration and work in
creating them. However, we were disappointed to read in the 2014 Plan EJ 2014 Progress Report
that work in this area is considered to be completed.

EPA’s approach has sought to prepare grassroots organizations to navigate a burdensome and
unfair federal grants system, rather than making real changes in the system that would simplify
the process and remove inequities for organizations representing overburdened communities.
The grant system itself can be a barrier to grassroots access to grants and information. We
believe that simplifying the grants process would harmonize with the spirit of the 1980
Regulatory Flexibility Act, which is intended to prevent federal regulations from creating undue
economic burdens on small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and non­profit
organizations, and to provide for recourse when such burdens arise.

In order for EPA to meet its goal to “Leverage federal resources to support community­based
efforts,” as stated in the Draft EJ 2020 Framework, EPA must think creatively about right­sizing
the grant process for smaller­dollar grants aimed at community organizations and small
businesses. One straightforward way to do that is to delegate grant management to a third party,
or ​pass­through entity​.

In effect, EPA could transform the EPA Small Grants Program from its current form into one
single award to a pass­through entity, to be disbursed by that entity to multiple Environmental
Justice organizations via subawards under a competitive process in compliance with ​2 CFR
§200.201​. The pass­through entity should be an institution with a successful track record of
grants administration, and demonstrated expertise in Environmental Justice. Such a third party
would be subject to the complex requirements of the federal grants system that are so
out­of­scale for small grantees (the requirements for pass­through entities are clearly spelled out
in ​2 CFR §200.331).​ EPA could provide one single award to the pass­through entity, whose
duties would be to create an RFP, collaborate with EPA to select subaward recipients, disburse
funds and collect reports from subawardees. The pass­through entity’s role would be to create a
grant­making process that is scaled down to a size and administrative burden that is actually
appropriate for the grant’s intended recipients. Feedback from past grantees could be used to
help develop a more streamlined process.

Such a process would transfer the bulk of the administrative burden of managing EPA grants
away from the grant recipients, and onto the pass­through entity serving as a professional
manager. Environmental Justice grantees would then be able to actually use the funds disbursed

                                                                                                   6

for program activities rather than for grants management. EPA would achieve greater efficiency
in the use of its grant funds by concentrating administrative costs associated with those grants
into one entity with the proven capacity to manage them effectively.

We hope that you will seriously consider re­working the Environmental Justice Small Grants
Program and other programs intended to bring federal resources into overburdened communities,
whether or not EPA pursues the specific course of action we have suggested as a remedy. Such
an endeavor would require creative thinking on EPA’s part, but can be accomplished in a way
that both satisfies the requirements of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles
and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR ​§​200 and 40 CFR ​§30​), and is scaled
appropriately to serve overburdened communities, rather than adding to their burdens.

Thank you very much for your Agency’s dedicated work to advance Environmental Justice, and
for the opportunity to comment on the EJ 2020 Draft Framework. We sincerely hope that
measurable results ­ reduced pollution and associated illness in overburdened communities ­ will
become the single, unifying goal of EJ 2020. The Environmental Law & Policy Clinic stands
ready to assist EPA in its goal to “demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened
communities.” We hope to meet with you soon to do just that.

Respectfully yours,
/s/

             Re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

    Dear Mr. Lee:

    Farmworker Justice (FJ) and the organizations listed below submit these comments in
    response to the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for public
    comment on the EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. We support EPA's
    work to make a difference in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and
    economically distressed communities, and urge EPA to consider farmworkers in its
    environmental justice initiatives. Historically underrepresented in EPA decision making,
    they face many health and environmental burdens not only at their workplaces, but also
    in the rural communities where they live. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers who
    cultivate and harvest labor-intensive crops on farms are especially at risk of harm from
    pesticides. Protection of farmworkers and their families falls squarely within the
    Agency’s stated priorities of environmental justice. However, EPA's Draft EJ 2020
    Action Agenda Framework does not address pesticides, which is the single largest
    environmental pollutant in farmworker communities. EPA must act in a more concerted
    way to address the disproportionate impact of environmental policies on farmworker
    communities.

    Farmworker Justice is a national, non-profit advocacy and education organization that
    works to improve working and living conditions for migrant and seasonal farmworkers
    and their families. Since its founding more than 30 years ago, FJ has advocated for
    agricultural workers in matters before the EPA, including issues relating to pesticides that
    pose unacceptable health and safety risks to farmworkers and their families and
    communities.

    General comments

    We support the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework and the agency’s commitment
    to environmental justice. We urge EPA to implement the plan throughout the entire



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            145
     agency, including in pesticide regulation decision-making, and to foster consideration and
    involvement of farmworkers in the Agency’s work.

    However, we note that the draft framework and resources such as the EJSCREEN
    completely ignore pesticide policy. Pesticide policy must be a priority for EPA. The
    agency should approach its role in pesticide regulation from an environmental justice
    perspective, placing particular concern on the health hazards posed by pesticides for
    overburdened populations, including agricultural pesticide handlers, other farmworkers,
    and their families. Furthermore, though pesticide registration does not fit easily into any
    of the focus areas (rulemaking, permitting, and scientific tool development do not seem
    to specifically address registration), EPA must ensure that implementation of Plan EJ
    2020 extends to its pesticide-related functions.

    As perhaps the most important of EPA’s pesticide-related functions, the registration
    process should be the first step in ensuring the safety of farmworkers and agricultural
    communities. Prohibiting the use of toxic chemicals is the most effective method for
    pesticide exposure reduction. Many studies show that farmworkers face significantly
    higher levels of pesticide exposure as compared with the national reference sample.1
    Despite wearing WPS-recommended clothing, wearing clean work clothes, and the
    combination of hand washing with soap and wearing gloves, workers have been found to
    have significantly high levels of exposure.2 Pesticide exposure must be curbed at the
    source. The absence of specific mention of EPA’s pesticide-related functions seems to
    suggest that the agency does not see environmental justice as relevant to its role as
    pesticide regulator. We hope this is not the case.

    EJSCREEN

    We support the use of EJSCREEN to screen geographic locations for overburdened
    populations who are disproportionately exposed to different types of pollution. The
    EJSCREEN uses 12 environmental justice indexes to measure environmental and
    demographic indicators. For the environmental indicators, the EPA uses the following EJ
    indexes: particulate matter, ozone, lead paint indicator, traffic proximity, proximity to
    national priority list sites, proximity to risk management plan facilities, proximity to
    treatment storage disposal facilities, and proximity to major direct water dischargers. For
    the demographic indicators, the EPA uses the following EJ indexes: low-income,
    minority, less than high school education, linguistic isolation, individuals under age 5,
    and individuals over age 64.

    As discussed above, we are disappointed that pesticide exposure is not included as one of
    the environmental indicators that the EPA will measure in the EJSCREEN. Pesticides are

    from pesticide exposure. However, in the interim, surrogate data based on crop surveys
    should be used to include pesticide exposure as an environmental indicator in the
    EJSCREEN.

    The farmworker community is a classic example of an overburdened population and
    satisfies many of the EJSCREEN's demographic indicators. There are approximately 2.4
    million farmworkers employed on farms and ranches in the U.S. According to the most
    recent National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), almost half of farmworkers are
    34 years old or younger, with an average annual income of $15,000 to $17,499.3 The
    vast majority of farmworkers are immigrants and 70% of them speak Spanish as their
    dominant language. We recommend that EJSCREEN include the farmworker community
    as one of the target demographics for EPA's environmental justice work.

    Section I(C): Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to
    improve the health and environment of overburdened communities

    EPA proposes to advance environmental justice through compliance and enforcement.
    We support this goal wholeheartedly, as vigorous and consistent enforcement of
    environmental regulations nationwide is a necessary aspect of environmental justice. In
    states where compliance monitoring and enforcement actions are inadequate, populations
    risk exposure to inequitable environmental and health hazards.

    In December 2011, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at EPA released a report
    contending that EPA does not administer a consistent national enforcement program and
    that state enforcement programs are underperforming, citing EPA data indicating a high
    rate of noncompliance coupled with a low level of enforcement.4 OIG concluded that the
    primary cause was EPA’s failure to consistently “hold states accountable for meeting
    enforcement standards”;5 “set clear and consistent national benchmarks”;6 and effectively
    curtail weak and inconsistent enforcement by states.”7 In response, EPA largely agreed
    with the overall findings that enforcement performance varied significantly nationwide.8

    OIG recommended, and we agree, that EPA should establish clear national lines of
    authority for enforcement that include canceling outdated guidance and policies;
    consolidating and clarifying remaining enforcement policies; establishing clear

     benchmarks for state performance; and establishing a clear policy describing when and
    how EPA will intervene in state enforcement.

    More recently, in May 2015, the OIG released a report which found that EPA's oversight
    of states' enforcement of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
    was insufficient due to “inadequate guidance and training.”9 OIG also criticized EPA for
    an “overall lack of records and transparency in how issues associated with state
    inspections are addressed.” For example, OIG noted that EPA project officers often
    failed to do basic tasks such as taking notes for inspection reports or including evidence
    for why they found states' enforcement actions to be appropriate.

    OIG recommended that EPA develop guidance on how project officers should conduct
    their oversight of state pesticide inspections and that project officers are periodically
    trained on best practices. We believe that the project officer training should include an
    opportunity to hear directly from farmworkers and their advocates about common
    violations they experience of the Worker Protection Standard and other pesticide laws
    and obstacles to reporting and compliance.

    Section II(B): Working with other federal agencies to advance environmental justice
    through the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice

    The Draft proposes to facilitate the active involvement of all federal agencies in
    advancing federal environmental justice and community-based activities as part of the
    Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (EJ IWG), which was
    established in 1994 under Executive Order 12898. We support this goal, particularly as it
    pertains to protecting farmworkers and agricultural communities from harmful pesticide
    exposure, and urge EPA to work with agencies such as the Occupational Safety & Health
    Administration (OSHA), the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national research agencies to
    achieve this objective.

    EPA should collaborate with research agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health
    and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, to obtain targeted research
    data to ensure its decisions regarding pesticide registration, risk assessments and worker
    safety standards are based on sound science that is free of industry influence. When
    assessing risk associated with a given pesticide (or class of pesticides), one of the goals
    can be to identify the exposure level that represents an acceptable level of risk.10 This is
    done by comparing the expected or estimated exposure to the toxicity of the pesticide.
    While sources of toxicity data include voluntary submissions by the registrants,
    additional research is needed to fill the data gaps that are rampant in farmworker
    occupational health issues. Unless adequate and peer reviewed studies are conducted to

     account for actual exposure experienced by farmworkers in real life circumstances, an
    accurate assessment of risk for pesticides cannot be achieved.

    Similarly, there is a glaring gap in information pertaining to the number of annual
    pesticide poisonings nationwide, since there is no national reporting system for exposure-
    related injuries. A partnership between the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and EPA to
    track and monitor incidents of pesticide poisoning would provide much needed exposure
    data. The lack of reliable statistics on pesticide-related injuries and the dearth of research
    on pesticides’ impact on farmworkers perpetuate EPA’s refusal to limit their use due to
    lack of evidence of causation of injuries and toxicity when assessing risk to human
    health.

    While EPA is the primary regulatory agency authorized to assess and reduce the risk of
    pesticide exposure and injuries among farmworkers, farmworkers would benefit greatly
    from a coordinated effort among federal agencies to implement the Worker Protection
    Standard (WPS) and provide workers with comprehensive information regarding
    pesticides and the associated health risks.

    Section II(C): Support transformative efforts in communities to advance
    environmental justice through EPA's Community Resources Network

    EPA also aims to empower communities to take action to improve their health and
    environment, through community engagement and responsiveness to community
    concerns. We fully support this goal and encourage EPA to work towards its full
    realization.

    EPA should begin a concerted outreach initiative to engage farmworkers and rural
    communities in the policymaking process and consult them on the health impacts of
    pesticides. EPA can include more farmworker representatives on agency advisory
    committees and solicit their input on decisions that will impact farmworkers. EPA should
    make meetings and materials more accessible to the majority of farmworkers, for whom
    Spanish is their primary language.11 Additionally, EPA should engage in outreach to the
    increasing number of farmworkers who come from indigenous communities of Mexico
    and Central America, and speak Mixteco, Triqui, or other indigenous languages. These
    workers experience particular hardships, including language and cultural barriers, racism,
    and extreme poverty, that may compound the disproportionate impact of environmental
    policies on their communities.

    Because of language barriers and limited access to electronic communication, many
    farmworkers cannot participate in the processes that EPA has established to receive
    feedback on environmental policy decisions. Since farmworkers tend to have low-wage
    jobs, they often cannot afford to buy computers. They also tend to live in substandard
    housing with no internet access. However, most farmworkers use mobile technology to
    access the internet. A qualitative study on the use of mobile technology among

     farmworkers in California found high rates of mobile phone use.12 Farmworkers ranked
    their mobile phone among their most important possessions and use them to talk, text,
    share photos, watch and record videos, listen to music, play games, and access the
    internet, among other uses. EPA should incorporate the use of mobile technology to
    communicate with farmworkers, and such communication should be both culturally and
    literacy appropriate for farmworkers and their family members.

    Finally, it has come time for EPA to acknowledge the reality of many farmworkers’
    limited English proficiency and mandate that pesticide labels be published in both
    English and Spanish. Without access to information about the dangers of the chemicals
    they work with every day, farmworkers will continue to suffer thousands of pesticide-
    related poisonings and illnesses a year. Bilingual labels would also give mixers,
    applicators, and harvesters the information they need to monitor their health impacts from
    particular pesticides, and inform EPA of the dangers of particular chemicals. Farmworker
    Justice, along with other advocacy groups, has petitioned EPA to require bilingual
    labels.13 EPA should act quickly to implement this common-sense environmental justice
    and civil rights policy.

    Section IV(b): EPA's implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act through a
    comprehensive, long-term Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Strategic Plan

    One of EPA’s most important civil rights-related functions relates to ensuring a fair and
    comprehensive complaint resolution process. EPA plans to develop a comprehensive,
    long-term OCR Strategic Plan to implement Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. We support
    EPA's work to implement Title VI to prevent discrimination against farmworkers and
    other vulnerable communities. However, EPA has a long way to go to ensure that
    allegations of discrimination are promptly investigated to accurately determine whether
    the civil rights laws have been violated and to provide the complainant with appropriate
    relief.

    For instance, in June 1999, a Title VI claim was filed, Angelita C. v. California
    Department of Pesticide Regulation, by the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment,
    California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation,
    and Farmworker Justice on behalf of Latino parents and children at 6 schools in
    California, alleging that the state’s Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR)
    discriminated against Latino school children by allowing unhealthy levels of methyl
    bromide to be applied near schools populated by mostly Latino children. While EPA
    determined that DPR’s actions were in fact discriminatory, the Agency’s subsequent
    handling of case was wholly inadequate for the affected parties.

    Once EPA found a violation, the Agency failed to inform the parents or their attorneys.
    Nor did EPA refer the civil rights violations to the U.S. Department of Justice for

     enforcement. Instead, EPA entered into secret negotiations with DPR. The terms of that
    settlement provided no relief for the children or their parents and only required additional
    monitoring of methyl bromide near schools and “outreach” by DPR. In order to
    effectively implement a robust and just civil rights complaint and compliance review
    process, EPA must include aggrieved parties in both the investigation and settlement
    process, which was clearly not done in the Angelita C case.

    Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda
    Framework. We support EPA’s efforts to advance environmental justice. However, as
    detailed above, there are additional policies that the Agency should adopt to carry out its
    responsibilities regarding environmental justice and civil rights for farmworkers and their
    families. We urge EPA to implement the plan throughout the entire Agency, including in
    pesticide regulation decision-making, and to foster consideration and involvement of
    farmworkers in the Agency’s work.

Subject:                         public comment for the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework


Dear EJ Strategy Representative;

        Please accept my comments for the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda framework (PDF).
Environmental Justice is based upon the reality that there is an adverse burden for participation in policy
making activities and decisions by community members that are stressed by environmental threats. In order
for EJ to provide appropriate and meaningful assistance for community members, the basic necessities for
participation must be addressed. Assistance in assessment, organization, planning, communication, legal
interpretation, evaluation, analysis and submission of recommendations to policy makers capable of bringing
about meaningful change must all be nurtured. I was not able to obtain answers to basic questions about the
current EPA EJ program prior to the submission of this email. Availability and access to concrete resources are
vitally important to survival of grass roots organizations. Although the EPA website is amazing and overflowing
with information, it is still very difficult for community folks to even know where to begin. By establishing a
commitment to a relationship with community groups (which I believe the both the 2014 and the 2020 plans
do) constituent contact is vitally important. There are records of previous quarterly conference calls on the
website, but no mention of current activities. The National, Arkansas and Texas EJ workshops were invaluable
to me attend, but what are plans for follow up? The planning committee is a great foundation for a local
stakeholder group, but to my knowledge there has been no request for ongoing participation. Ensuring
ongoing communication at the state, region and national level with community groups, could very well be an
opportunity to provide them with access to resources that are critically necessary for their survival. So many
forces work against volunteer community group success, that whatever we can do to provide concrete
accessible resources would be a very good thing.

These are examples of two organizations that provide free access to step‐by‐step guidance to improving
community health. Maybe this type of resource is already available from the EPA and I just don’t know about
it.

Community Tool Box http://ctb.ku.edu/en

Including step by step such as provided by the two resources above, could go a long way in improving
stakeholder participation.

Additionally, participation expenses in EPA sponsored events should be prepaid by the hosting agency.
Requiring community members to bear the burden of the expense is unreasonable. The reimbursement
process now (in my experience of attending both the Texas and Arkansas EJ workshops) takes an excessive
amount of time and numerous mistakes were made by EPA staff in processing the paperwork. Agency
employees are not subjected to this treatment, neither should community members.

 Additional funding should be made easily available and in a timely manner to support community based
organizational activities to address significant environmental concerns. Increasing community member access
to technical assistance and training resources would assist to both further the mission of EPA EJ and promote
community health and wellbeing.

Good Evening,


I'd like to submit the following comment on behalf of the First Peoples Conservation Council of Louisiana.


""We are pleased to see EPA's continued commitment to furthering environmental justice through its programs,
policies, and activities. We wish to provide the following input to the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework: In
order to fully support environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed
communities, EPA must specifically reach out to and engage with non-Federally Recognized Tribes. There current
draft mentions the importance of coordination with Tribes multiple times, but the existing policy on consultation with
Tribes is limited to those Tribes with Federal recognition. Although the current draft does specifically reference
Indigenous Peoples, we feel that it is critical that non-federally recognized Tribes be explicitly mentioned as
stakeholders as well.""

Re:       AMS comments on EPA Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

July 14, 2015

The Alliance for Metropolitan Stability (AMS) is a coalition of grassroots organizations that advances racial,
economic and environmental justice in growth and development patterns in the Twin Cities region. Our 31
member groups represent communities of color, low‐income communities, housing advocates, faith‐based
organizations, research and policy organizations, economic developers and environmental, transit and land‐use
policy advocates. See http://www.metrostability.org/about_us/member_list.php

Thank you for your efforts to strengthen enforcement of Environmental Justice policies and practices at the
federal level. We are seeing the results within our local jurisdictions and your efforts have provided our local
environmental justice communities with additional leverage to protect their community members from further
harm and begin to address the unjust overburden their communities bear for the sake of our economy and
industry.

Here are our comments on the EPA Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework:

1. Referencing page 2: II. Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened communities.
   1. Collaborate with states, tribes, local governments and other co‐regulators to share and develop
   environmental justice tools and practices:

      A. EPA funded local state agencies should be required to report on the information gathered on their
         identified overburdened communities (such as EJ community assessments) to the public via their
         websites and in addition send these reports to local planning jurisdictions such as metropolitan planning
         organizations, counties, and cities to be used as land use planning tools to ensure that land use planning
         does not contribute to additional environmental burdens.

      B. In addition EPA funded local state agencies should be required to submit any reports generated on their
         identified overburdened communities (such as EJ community assessments) to their state Department of
         Health and other health departments at county and city levels to ensure a comprehensive approach to
         reducing Environmental Justice health disparities.

2. Referencing page 3: C. Support transformative efforts in communities to advance environmental justice
   through EPA’s Community Resources Network:

      A. Promote EPA locally funded jurisdictions to contract directly with Environmental Justice grassroots
         communities for engagement and outreach to increase their capacity to apply their expertise on
         community engagement practices on addressing environmental challenges. Example: Metropolitan
         Council Corridors of Opportunity Sustainable Communities Planning Grant
         http://www.corridorsofopportunity.org/partners/community‐engagement‐team and
         http://engagetc.org/grants/

                                                                                                                   1

      EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                17
    B. Require each EPA funded local state agency to form Environmental Justice Advisory Committees to
      oversee local state agency environmental justice outreach and engagement; priority setting; regulatory
      programs; monitoring, assessment and consideration of cumulative impacts; equity in rulemaking, policy
      development, and program implementation; and environmental justice assessments.


3. Referencing page 3: III. Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities. C. In
   addition to measuring outcomes in particular communities, invite comment on whether there are a few
   critical nationwide program areas that matter to overburdened communities on which we should focus
   national attention (e.g., drinking water, lead paint):

       A. Consider assessment of environmental justice communities within land use planning as a nationwide
          program area.

4. Final Comment: Successful outcomes of a healthy and prosperous community require effective and
   authentic community engagement. EJ communities have a long history of disregard, disrespect, and
   disinvestment by government that has resulted in harmful and destructive public practices. The unfortunate
   outcome of these public practices are the health disparities within all EJ communities. Another unfortunate
   result is the lasting distrust EJ communities hold for their local government.

   To overcome this distrust will take time and will require successful outcomes for EJ communities. Here in the
   Twin Cities, EJ communities partnered with the Metropolitan Council to establish regional standards in
   community engagement. The result was this draft document: Metropolitan Council Public Engagement Plan
   http://metrostability.org/efiles/PEP‐DraftforOutreach_(3).pdf. This document is an excellent example of
   how community principles can be integrated into a public policy document.

   It is our best hope that during this time of political receptivity to EJ communities, we can embed best
   practices into public agencies’ culture and policies that will sustain through time and provide an open door
   to future generations to come.




                                                                                                                  2

process to try to improve upon already established plans and actions about the Environment. It is especially

important to emphasize an overlooked part of the Environment, which is Environmental Justice.


            To build upon the previously Plan, which was EJ 2014, is a smart idea in many ways. I like how a lot of

the work in this new plan is based off of the old one. Having the old plan to reference and show, as proof of

improvement will encourage a lot of people to change their ways. This could have a tremendous positive effect

on overburdened communities who just need that little push to get things going in the right direction again. The

only negative of basing the new plan on the old one is maybe the old plan did not have the same good result in

all regions. There could have been a few scattered negative results that will see nothing good coming from the

new plan.


            Environmental Justice is such a sensitive topic because it involves races and prejudices. There must

always be precautions in place to make sure a plan is focused to divert the negatives of what racism can bring. I

believe with things mentioned in this plan like more collaboration with partners, communities will begin to see

how they can progress. The good thing about collaboration is that if positive results are shown from one case,

then others will follow suit, and a whole slew of positive integration will result.




                                                               1

        I believe this plan is a great next step in the process of bettering Environmental Justice as a whole.

Relying on the backbone of the old plan to reinstitute a new plan will prove to be worthwhile when it comes

down to it.

            To Whom It May Concern



            As a young Mexican-American who grew up in The Bronx, NYC, the environmental justice work of the
            EJ 2020 Action Agenda makes me very proud. The amount of trash, non-recycled recyclables, and
            poorly maintained non-environmental infrastructure that I have witnessed and have experienced around
            my local city is enormous, which undoubtedly has led to environmental degradation in my community.
            Although we are proud people, we are not very environmentally aware of what is going on. This is why
            I think section II, subsection C is so important and should be focused on. Using community-based,
            public-private partnerships for general and location specific engagement. If the people know and are
            aware we can help. Inspire us!



            I am very excited to see what is implemented in overburdened communities and the achievements made
            by the EPA. Hopefully my local community is reached too, but within a few years I would like to make
            an impact in my local governments decision making, which as of section II, subsection A, should be
            promoted with consideration of environmental justice, which would provide the greatest moral approach
            to reaching sustainability in our community.



            After looking over the draft I come closer to realizing that my career path may lie in environmental
            policy, and would be honored to help further what the EJ 2020 Action Agenda is going to change in my
            local community.



            Deep Regards,

Subject:                         EJ 2020 priority


One of the most pressing issues for EPA to address in EJ2020 Action Agenda is the issue of reducing near‐roadway air
pollution, and the associated health risks (dangers), for those who live, work and go to school or daycare within a mile of
a major roadway.

The documented health risks span from documented increases in asthma, ER visits, higher rates of autism, even to
childhood leukemia, and more. We also know that pregnant mothers have higher rates of preeclampsia when exposed
to certain near roadway air pollutants. We want EPA, from the top down, to develop a tangible strategy to not only
protect our citizens but to educate the most vulnerable. We need a clear strategy with clear environmental / health
results identified. We need asthma and cancer rates to go down in children. We cannot tell people to merely go indoors
when the air quality is bad outdoors because the ambient air issues can compound indoors and can be at elevated
levels.

We can address this issue using the existing Clean Air Act, and associated regulations. In EJ areas, we can require and
deploy additional near‐roadway air monitoring (more than what is required by the Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality
Standards, NAAQS), use existing NAAQS required State Implementation Plan development opportunities (require EJ
involvement in the State Implementation Planning process to address near roadway concerns in counties areas of the
U.S. that are not attaining the NAAQS), use tools with Transportation Conformity, require project level conformity hot‐
spot analyses and more.

Addressing this national children's health emergency is the right thing to do. If EPA ignores this crisis of delays action on
an issue that disproportionately negatively impacts minorities, then this becomes another issue of environmental
racism. We must do all that we can to make tangible difference to protect the health of the most vulnerable (pregnant
mothers, infants and children) from the dangers of near‐roadway air pollution.

          Re:      Comments on draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda framework

 Dear Mr. Lee,

         Housing Land Advocates(HLA) provides advocacy, education, technical assistance and
 legal representation on land use matters affecting affordable housing.

         Since our founding in 2004, we have worked with local governments, interest groups,
 affordable housing providers, land use policy makers, and planners to ensure that state and
 local housing obligations are being met.

        Throughout all that we do, collaboration with other organizations has been a key
 strategy. We know that the impacts of housing affordability reach far beyond the basic need for
 shelter: Housing is tied to public health, racial equity, and environmental issues. Our work has
 brought people together around common interests, creating a stronger voice for everyone.

         HLA applauds the EPA's efforts to advance and integrate environmental justice from the
 federal to local level. Undoubtedly, these efforts will positively impact environmentally
 overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities.

          Please consider the following comments to the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda framework:

      1. Include the private sector and non-profits in EPA's definition of partners.

     As is, the EJ 2020 Action Agenda includes the private sector and non-profits as a resource
 group but not as a group to engage for purposes of establishing best practices and new
 strategies. HLA recognizes that the private sector and non-profits may already be represented
 and engaged in EPA's process. However, HLA would like to point out that formally including all
 stakeholders early in the process is a good way to ensure buy in to EPA's environmental justice
 programs and initiatives.

      2. Include more substance and guidance in the EJ 2020 Action Agenda.

    The nature of strategy documents requires broad, overarching goals. To the extent
 possible, HLA encourages the EPA to include more details, substance, and guidance in the EJ
 Action Agenda. For instance, for each of the broad goals, the EPA could include illustrative
 examples of actions that the EPA views as a means to accomplish the broader goal.
EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                     159
      3. Improve communication regarding environmental justice to the community at large.

     Regarding compliance and enforcement actions, the EPA plans to enhance communication
 and transparency with affected communities and the public regarding environmental justice
 concerns. HLA believes that this plan is very important. A communication strategy aimed at
 the community at large, to the affected communities will allow other members of the
 community to voice concerns on behalf of affected communities because oftentimes the
 affected communities are underrepresented at the leadership and decision-making table.
 Accordingly, expanding the communication target could bring more attention and support to an
 environmental issue that impacts an environmentally overburdened, underserved, and
 economically distressed community.

     4. Include strategies that demonstrate community enhancement without displacement.

     With regard to demonstrating progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened
 communities, the EPA plans to show positive impacts of the EPA's work through community-
 level results, such as revitalization and sustainability, partnerships and collaborative problem-
 solving, and grass roots capacity building. It is important to show the positive impact, and
 thereby the significance, of EPA's efforts to affected communities. HLA suggests that EPA also
 include strategies to demonstrate the positive impacts of EPA's programs in affected
 communities. The positive impacts should include overall enhancement or improvement
 without displacement of long-time residents or disruption of the affected community's existing
 social network.

    We hope that these comments are helpful. Thank you for your efforts to advance
 environmental justice and for the opportunity to comment.

                                                              Sincerely,

         Re: Comment on the inclusion of prisoner populations in EPA’s Draft
             Framework for EJ 2020 Action Agenda

Dear Mr. Lee:

The Human Rights Defense Center’s (HRDC) Prison Ecology Project and the undersigned
organizations submit the following comment on the Environmental Protection Agency’s EJ 2020
Action Agenda Framework.

While it is encouraging to see the EPA attempting to increase the effectiveness of Executive
Order 12898 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in protecting communities that have been
overburdened by industrial pollution, we also find that there is a significant piece missing to the
dialogue thus far: recognition of the vast number of prisoners and their families as an extremely
and uniquely overburdened population.1

The need for EJ 2020 comes from the unfortunate reality that many of the environmental permit
approvals that have taken place in recent decades, and continue today, fall into a category of
poverty discrimination policies which almost exclusively impact poor communities, with a
disproportionate impact on poor communities of color. Few industrial sectors exemplify this
more clearly than the prison industry.2

1
  HRDC uses the term “prisoner” to refer to people held in prisons, jails, detention facilities, civil commitment
centers and other facilities that hold people against their will as punishment or while awaiting court-related
proceedings, i.e. trial, sentencing, deportation, etc.
2
  On July 9, 2015, Prison Policy Initiative released a new report on prisoner income: “Using an underutilized data set
from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, this report provides hard numbers on the low incomes of incarcerated men and
women from before they were locked up.… The American prison system is bursting at the seams with people who
have been shut out of the economy and who had neither a quality education nor access to good jobs. We found that,
in 2014 dollars, incarcerated people had a median annual income of $19,185 prior to their incarceration, which is
41% less than non-incarcerated people of similar ages.” Source: http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html

 A recent report from the Prison Policy Initiative shows that, according to the U.S. Census,
blacks are incarcerated at a rate five times that of whites, and Hispanics/Latinos are nearly
twice as likely to be incarcerated as whites. It goes further to illustrate that white people are
underrepresented in every one of the 50 states’ prison populations, whereas Hispanic/Latino,
black and Native Americans are consistently overrepresented in every state.3

There are over 2.3 million people incarcerated in prisons, jails, immigration detention centers
and other correctional facilities in the United States; if all of those prisoners were housed in one
location, it would constitute the fourth largest city in the nation with a population greater than
that of Houston, Texas.4

If we can recognize the problem with forcing people to live in close proximity to toxic and
hazardous environmental conditions, then why are we ignoring prisoners who are forced to live
in detention facilities impacted by such conditions?

We realize that the federal government’s responsibilities are divided up among multiple
agencies, with the EPA dealing primarily in issues related to ambient pollution. As such, some
of the issues addressed below may be outside the EPA’s immediate jurisdiction, but we
understand the EPA to be leading the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice and
feel that you will be able to best discern which agencies are best positioned to address the unique
circumstances of prisoner populations.5

While we cannot speak to the knowledge of all federal agencies, we do know that both the EPA
and the Department of Justice (DOJ) are well informed about the environmental impact of mass
incarceration on poor communities in general and poor communities of color in particular, and
that this impact affects both those imprisoned in detention facilities and those who are employed
in or live near them.6

The intention of this comment is to provide background on how prisoners are excluded from
environmental justice protections, both in the permitting of prisons themselves and the
permitting of other industrial facilities operating in proximity to prisons. We have also provided
a dozen examples of how and where this has manifested in various regions throughout the
country.

  For example, EPA has a Memorandum of Understanding with OSHA:

This presumably takes the Department of Labor’s “Environmental Justice Strategy” into consideration:

  While prisons themselves are sources of outdoor pollution, e.g. particulates from outdated prison boilers,
discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage, etc., which affect surrounding communities that also often
fit the criteria of EJ communities, that matter is not what we are addressing in this particular comment.


EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                        162
 Background on the EPA and Prisons

Since 1999, the Office of Enforcement, Compliance, and Environmental Justice (OECEJ) within
EPA Region III office has conducted what they call a “prison initiative.” Although this initiative
has not been very active in conducting inspections since about 2011, over the course of a decade,
EPA Region III conducted multiple investigations of conditions in prisons which resulted in a
broad spectrum of enforcement actions.7 This initiative is well-documented through articles and
press releases published online and in printed publications such as the National Environmental
Enforcement Journal.8

Over the past six months HRDC’s Prison Ecology Project has been conducting extensive
research, public records requests, interviews and reviews of Environmental Impact Statements
and Environmental Assessments to understand how environmental justice criteria has been
applied to prisoner populations, given the overwhelming evidence that prisoners are
disproportionately people of color and almost entirely low-income, regardless of race. We are
disappointed to report that we have seen no information pointing to any intention of the EPA
to recognize the population of people in prison, despite the fact that they constitute the most
vulnerable and overburdened demographic of citizens in the country.

In an interview conducted by the Prison Ecology Project on February 5, 2015, EPA Region III
representative Donna Heron explained explicitly that environmental justice guidelines have not
been applied to prisoners because the EPA uses census data which does not take prisoners into
account.

We find this reason to be insufficient. We believe that data exists or could be gathered to allow
the EPA to effectively and accurately determine environmental impacts on incarcerated
populations. If the EPA’s chosen data happens not to include these populations, the EPA should
seek to supplement the data for these missing populations by conducting research on what other
data sources should be included to provide the most accurate picture of the populations who will
be subject to any environmental impacts.9

We also found that prison-related permitting has often attempted to claim a Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) in permitting, or worse, has alleged “categorical exclusions” that
keep these plans off the radar of public input.10 We feel that when plans are being made that

7
  Until very recently, the activity of Region III’s prison initiative was documented online, but it was removed for an
unknown reason. Some of the information previously posted online can now only be found on the Prison Ecology
Project’s website: http://PrisonEcology.org
8
  In particular, an article written by EPA inspector Garth Conner titled “An Investigation and Analysis of the
Environmental Problems at Prisons” was published in the May 2003 edition of the NEE Journal, addressing the
overpopulation of prisons and the industrial facilities operated within them. The article highlighted six separate
investigations which all resulted in a broad spectrum of enforcement activity at state, federal and local correctional
facilities.
9
  HRDC is requesting further dialogue with EPA staff on this matter, as the methods used by the EPA to gather
population data, and the consistency of those methods, are currently unclear.
10
   The following is a 2014 announcement of a FONSI on a 2,000-bed immigrant detention facility, before there was
even a site selected. According to the notice, “A geographical restriction associated with the RFP required the
facility to be located in one of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, or New
York. See: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-09-26/html/2014-22616.htm

 involve the incarceration of hundreds or thousands of low-income people, for which there are
alternatives to incarcerating in the first place, this must be viewed as a significant environmental
justice impact.

The DOJ, BOP and Environmental Justice

        “During the twenty years since Executive Order 12898 was issued, there have been
        significant accomplishments by community leaders, Federal, state, local and tribal
        governments, and others to advance this important work. Yet there is more work to be
        done. Low-income, minority, and tribal Americans are still disproportionately burdened
        with pollution, resulting in disproportionate health problems, greater obstacles to
        economic growth, and a lower quality of life. The Department will continue to play a
        vital role in making environmental justice a reality for all Americans. We welcome []
        input on the Department’s environmental justice activities, strategy, and guidance as
        we move forward.”

        — Stuart F. Delery, Acting Associate Attorney General, from the DOJ’s 2014
        Implementation Progress Report on Environmental Justice11

The DOJ’s updated guiding document on Environmental Justice Strategy contains much lip-
service to viewing EJ as a priority. In section III.C.4, “Specific Component Obligations,” the
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is “working to ensure that its activities are consistent with
the President’s mandate [Executive Order 12898]. For example, the Bureau will include
consideration of environmental justice in its environmental impact statements [EIS] under
the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA].”12

During the period that EPA conducted its prison initiative in Region III, reports also surfaced
about rampant pollution and environmental health problems stemming from industrial facilities
in federal prisons nationwide. According to a 2010 report, the Justice Department’s Office of
the Inspector General pinpointed “numerous violations of health, safety and environmental laws,
regulations and (Bureau of Prisons) policies” at certain prison industry programs.13

However, according to our research, the BOP has never taken its prisoner population into
consideration under NEPA’s EJ guidance. This remained true as of the agency’s most recent
example of a NEPA-required EIS, which was published for public comment earlier this year for
a facility in Letcher County, Kentucky. HRDC prepared a comment which, among other issues,
addressed insufficient efforts to address EJ-related concerns.14 The following is an excerpt from
HRDC’s comment submitted to the BOP:

         Under the Environmental Justice guidelines of NEPA, and according to the EIS, the
        people most probable to be in BOP custody if this facility was built are very likely to meet
        the criteria for recognition as Environmental Justice communities. Inside the prison, the
        racial demographics and income of prisoners can be reasonably projected to populate
        the facility based on the demographics of other BOP facilities in the country.… The BOP
        reports 41% percent of its population to be of non-white “minority” status,15 whereas
        this racial demographic only makes up approximately 25% of the entire US population.16
        The EIS also says nothing of prisoners’ status as an almost entirely low-income
        population.

The EIS goes on to allege that, essentially, the only EJ impact to the local community (which is
a low-income rural region of Appalachia) will be the positive economic benefits associated with
the prison. The most obvious oversight here is that the region is known to have extreme water
contamination problems due to decades of heavy coal mining operations. In fact, both proposed
sites for the anticipated BOP facility are located on abandoned mines.17

In a review of a 2010 Environmental Assessment (EA) for a state prison being turned over to the
BOP for use as a supermax prison in Thomson, Illinois, HRDC found a very similar approach to
EJ matters with respect to permitting.18 This facility, which will be used for extreme isolation
units (solitary confinement) when opened, included no mention in its permits of the anticipated
demographics which would populate the prison. It also overlooked the need to review operating
such a facility in a flood zone, less than half-a-mile from the Mississippi River, and what unique
challenges this could pose to an extremely vulnerable population likely to fit the criteria of an EJ
demographic.

Our position is that the DOJ, as a participating agency in the implementation of EJ strategy,
should require prisoner populations to be explicitly included in the EJ 2020 process.

Below are some additional examples which illustrate the need for recognizing prisoners in
environmental justice policy and implementation strategy:

            New Orleans, Louisiana jail post-Katrina – This facility became an example of how
             ill-prepared county-run prisons are to handle emergency situations, sparking a report
             by the ACLU on the terrible reality that unfolded for prisoners after the storm in
             2005. “The prisoners inside the Orleans Parish Prison suffered some of the worst
             horrors of Hurricane Katrina,” said Eric Balaban, a staff attorney for the ACLU’s

              National Prison Project. “Because society views prisoners as second-class citizens,
             their stories have largely gone unnoticed and therefore untold.”19

            Escambia County, Florida jail flood – In May 2014, another flood-related disaster
             at a county-run jail on the Gulf Coast illustrated that very little had been done since
             the lessons of Katrina to address the dangers of incarcerating people in increasingly
             flood-prone areas. At the Escambia County jail in north Florida, severe rain led to
             flooding in the basement of the facility that in turn resulted in a gas leak and
             explosion that killed two prisoners and injured many others.20

            Chemical spill in Charleston, West Virginia – Another risk to prisoners, who are
             often located in industrial wastelands where the likelihood of pollution disasters can
             contaminate the water supply, was demonstrated at the South Central Regional Jail in
             Charleston after a major coal-processing-related chemical spill occurred in January
             2014 when a storage tank ruptured. Prisoners were affected by the water
             contamination to a greater extent than many other local residents, as they were
             exposed to the contaminated water for longer periods without proper notice.21

            Sing Sing Correctional Facility and the Indian Point nuclear plant in New York – A
             2012 legal proceeding filed by environmental groups in the Hudson Valley of New
             York during an administrative hearing of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
             exposed a completely insufficient emergency evacuation plan for prisoners held at
             Sing Sing Correctional Facility, again illustrating why this population fits the criteria
             of an EJ demographic.22

            Rikers Island jail, New York City – The Rikers Island jail complex has become
             notorious for its location on a toxic waste landfill site where lawsuits have been filed
             against the facility by employees who have become ill due to the conditions there.23
             As a result of this landfill, there have been frequent methane gas explosions on the
             site. In addition, the lack of an evacuation plan during Hurricane Sandy illustrated the
             increased potential for disaster at this facility.

            Coal ash dump in LaBelle, Pennsylvania – Surveys and reports from prisoners at the
             State Correctional Institute-Fayette have indicated ongoing problems related to
             sickness among prisoners who are exposed to airborne coal dust. The prison houses
             over 2,000 prisoners, was built on top of a former coal mine and sits adjacent to a
             506-acre coal ash dump owned and operated by Matt Canestrale Contracting (MCC).
             The dump receives ash waste from coal-fired power plants throughout the region.

              Before it became a fly ash dump, it was one of the world’s largest coal preparation
             plants, which left over 40 million tons of coal waste. MCC recently renewed its
             permit to dump 416,000 tons of coal ash per year at the site. Coal ash contains
             mercury, lead, arsenic, hexavalent chromium, cadmium and thallium. “In short,
             coal ash toxins have the potential to injure all of the major organ systems, damage
             physical health and development, and even contribute to mortality,” according to a
             report by Physicians for Social Responsibility.24

            Thirteen Colorado prisons in contaminated area – Cañon City is the location of nine
             state and four federal prisons and penitentiaries. It’s also known for longstanding
             water quality problems related to the mining and processing of uranium. Liquid waste
             laced with radioactive material and heavy metals was discharged into 11 unlined
             ponds from 1958-1978. Those were replaced in 1982 with two lined impoundments,
             and after well tests in Cañon City showed contamination, the uranium mill site was
             put on a national list for Superfund cleanups. Samples collected from four wells north
             of the mill in October 2011, analyzed at outside labs, indicated trichloroethene
             concentrations of 1,800 parts per billion, 1,200 ppb, 490 ppb and 386 ppb. The EPA
             standard is 5 ppb. The wells were up to 360 times the federal health limit. “Vapors
             can seep up through the soil and get into homes. Then you have not only a drinking
             issue but an inhalation risk,” EPA spokeswoman Sonya Pennock said. But the
             cleanup isn’t expected until 2027.25

            Valley Fever at Avenal and Pleasant Valley State Prisons, California – Lawsuits and
             news reports have repeatedly noted that people imprisoned in areas prone to valley
             fever (resulting from drought, over-development and increased temperatures) are at
             elevated risk of contracting that disease due to constant exposure and abysmal
             healthcare options available in prisons.26 Valley fever has claimed the lives of more
             than 50 prisoners and sickened thousands of others. A federal court ordered the
             removal of thousands of prisoners from the Avenal State Prison and Pleasant Valley
             State Prison due to concerns about valley fever. “Medical studies have shown that
             Filipinos, [B]lacks, Hispanics and people suffering from diabetes and HIV are more
             susceptible to valley fever, meaning that prisoners in the Central Valley – where 16
             of California’s 33 adult prisons are located – are especially vulnerable. For example,
             blacks comprise just 6.6% of California’s general population but make up 29% of the
             state’s prison population.”27

            Arsenic in Texas and California water supplies – This is a reoccurring story, where
             prisons such as Kern Valley State Prison in Delano, California and the Wallace Pack

             prisoners are forced to endure health impacts due to these environmental conditions.28

            Prisons built on military Superfund site in California – The Victorville Federal
             Correctional Complex was built on the site of one of the Weapons Storage Areas
             (WSA) for the former George Air Force Base in California, Superfund ID:
             CA2570024453. The DOD and Air Force did a federal-to-federal transfer of Parcel K
             to the BOP, a site which contains the former South WSA. The Victorville Federal
             Correctional Complex (FCC) consists of three facilities: FCI Victorville Medium I,
             Medium II and United States Penitentiary-Victorville.29 A federal-to-federal transfer
             was also done with Castle Air Force Base’s WSA where the United States
             Penitentiary (USP) in Atwater was built “on a part of the base near where munitions
             were kept and where investigators from the Air Force Safety Center suspect nuclear
             weapons were maintained and stored.”30

            Toxic and hazardous site for immigrant detention in Tacoma, Washington – The
             Northwest Detention Center, a privately-operated prison designed to house 1,575
             immigrants, is adjacent to a Superfund site known as Project Area #3 of the Tacoma
             Tar Pits (EPA ID# WAD980726368).31 The location is also in a designated volcanic
             hazard zone.32

            Water contamination in prisons nationwide – A report published by Prison Legal
             News in 2007 highlighted seventeen states, including Alabama, Georgia, Indiana,
             Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio and Washington, where water contamination in
             prisons and their surrounding communities had been reported to cause problems
             including illness (such as Legionnaire’s Disease) and various environmental
             violations.33 The report concluded that protections under the Clean Water Act may
             be difficult for prisoners, as such problems are often complex, requiring water testing
             and expert witnesses to prove a claim, neither of which are likely to be available to
             the average pro se prisoner litigant. According to author John Dannenberg, “As the
             environmental movement in the United States grows, it may be time to make the
             connection to environmental degradation caused by mass imprisonment.”

 Alternatives to Incarceration

While most of these issues present environmental justice concerns in a traditional sense of
the concept, there is another component which is an overarching matter for many if not all of
the examples listed above—the existence of alternatives to incarceration.34 The review of
alternatives is an integral piece of permitting through NEPA. When considering the value or
need for a prison, there should be a review of the ways in which a reduction in prisoner
populations would reduce or eliminate the need for expanding or constructing prisons, and
thus reduce or eliminate the resulting environmental justice concerns.

Impacts on Children

In addition, we feel that consideration of environmental justice impacts on prisoners should
extend to the families of prisoners as well, in particular those with children. Statistics show that
one in 28 children have a parent in prison—2.7 million children are growing up in households
in which one or more parents are incarcerated. Two-thirds of these parents are incarcerated for
nonviolent offenses, primarily drug offenses. One in nine black children has an incarcerated
parent, compared to one in 28 Hispanic/Latino children and one in 57 white children.35 Even
Sesame Street has taken note of the plight of children with parents in prison.36

The absence of a parent due to incarceration has a significant impact on the communities where
these children live. This factor should be considered among a review of the cumulative impacts
that affect environmental justice communities.37 And while a parent’s absence may be
temporary, negative health impacts resulting from incarceration can continue far beyond a
prisoner’s release date, causing additional financial and emotional hardships for families with
children.

Next Steps

For the above-stated reasons, HRDC and the undersigned organizations ask the EPA to use the
EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework to ensure that the millions of prisoners in this country
receive the protections that are intended under Executive Order 12898 and Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act.

 HRDC would like to participate further in the EPA’s EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, to
ensure that prisoners are taken into consideration with respect to environmental justice and
impacts on minority and low-income populations. Please contact me to discuss how we may do
so. For example, one of our staff can be available for a meeting in-person or via conference call,
and we can invite participation from other stakeholders and advocates in the prisoners’ rights
and criminal justice reform community who are interested in this issue.

Thank you for reviewing our concerns; I look forward to further communication on this subject.
If you have questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,



Paul Wright.

environmental justice through the EJ2020 Action Agenda Framework (EJ 2020). IQAir is an industry-
leader in air purification technologies and is dedicated to helping people live longer, healthier lives
through these air quality products.

Please consider the following comments as you review EJ 2020 and create the corresponding
implementation plan.

Goal 1: Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and
environment of overburdened communities.

For goal 1, IQAir urges USEPA to consider prioritizing mitigation efforts as it pertains to educational
environments.

There is ample discussion and action related to air quality improvement as a prevention measure, as
prevention is a vital part of the solution. At the same time, some communities need immediate relief.
These populations can’t afford to wait until the air quality improvements take effect. Therefore,
mitigation needs to be prioritized in highly impacted areas.

Mitigation provides immediate solutions and relieve those who suffer the largest burden of air pollution.
There are schools across the nation engulfed by terrible air quality, leaving children and school staff
exposed to air pollution, volatile organic compounds, and other lung irritants.

As children spend a substantial amount of time in school, these buildings should be safe, healthy and
promote productivity. Since 1 in 10 children suffers from asthma and asthma is the number one reason
for absenteeism of school-age children, something has to be done.

IQAir has partnered with local air quality management districts, school administrators and facility
managers to install our technology in schools across Southern California. Our filters provide the highest
air purification possible and exceeds the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s requirements.
More efforts like these, that provide immediate relief, are essential while longer-term prevention and
abatement strategies are implemented. If not, disparate populations that already bear the burden of
poor air quality will continue to suffer.

Goal 2: Collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened communities.

For goal 2, IQAir urges USEPA to not only foster collaboration with local community partners but to put
these collaborations to action. This will ensure EJ 2020 building on the groundwork laid by Plan EJ 2014.
Continue to emphasize the “meet communities where they are” approach that is highlighted under this
goal. Sharing best practices can only go so far without adequate funding and support to put these into
action.

Consider modifying the restrictions of which types of agencies are eligible for this funding as well. As a
corporate partner, we are restricted from applying on behalf of community partners and/or school
districts who would benefit from these funds. Our goal is to provide our technology to the most
vulnerable locations and support our partners in the process. Restrictions on funding for these projects
is a huge barrier when working with small, non-profit advocacy groups who do not have the capacity to
support the administration and execution of large federal grants.

 For example, in a mitigation grant, we recommend that the following stakeholders be required when
applying for funding: advocacy group, local air quality agency, government agency benefiting from
funding, and air filtration contractor. This high-level cooperation ensures that the funding is used
properly, the project is professionally administered, and that the burdened community benefits.

Dear EPA:

Given the fact that most communities facing EJ challenges are also distressed, with high poverty and unemployment, the
Agenda should emphasize opportunities for community members to be engaged in and employed by the functions
seeking to remediate or eliminate the EJ‐causing conditions.

In addition, technologies and processes which enhance employment and business opportunities for the impacted
communities should be given some preference.

Thanks for considering this comment.

Regards,

I have reviewed the draft EJ strategy fro 2020, and have a few comments. It would be nice if EPA
could include a couple of place-based commitments, like improve environmental conditions in X, Y, or
Z communities, e.g., South Bronx, NY (not meant to single-out this community); or to expand the
commitments to outcomes expected, e.g., restore water quality standards in xx underserved
watersheds by NPDES permitting, etc. You could ask the EPA Regions to come up with some
specific place-based outcomes based on current or planned permitting or other EPA regulatory
targets, which I am sure they have but do not recognize as EJ. Thanks for the opportunity to
comment.

                                 Ignores Environmental Justice Issues.docx


I would like to offer the following comments on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework.
I would offer the following summary comments:

1. While concern for promoting environmental justice should permeate all of EPA's activities, often
specific actions to promote environmental justice are not part of EPA activities. I would recommend
that as part of any EPA action (for example, to remediate a site under Superfund), there be
developed a specific, concrete and detailed action plan for promoting environmental justice. (Of
course, this recommendation would pertain only to sites where there was a specific environmental
justice community.) In Butte, Montana, for example, there is a Superfund site in the middle of town
called central Butte. This area has a disproportionate number of low-income citizens and so is an
environmental justice community. The Montana Office of EPA has never addressed environmental
justice concerns in this area. Either the Montana Office of EPA doesn't know what is environmental
justice or they choose to ignore the mandate in any effective way.

2. The Draft has lofty goals and ideals but lacks specifics. It expresses pious sentiments. On the
ground, when EPA acts pursuant to a plan of action that plan of action needs a specific, concrete,
measurable and definitive environmental justice component.

3. When doing health risk assessments, EPA needs to give specific consideration to environmental
justice communities. For example, for various reasons, low-income citizens are more prone to the
effects of exposure to toxics than are the non-poor. Yet, traditional health risk assessment fails to
take this into account.

4. Specific, concrete and measurable outreach activities for reaching environmental justice
communities should be a part of all EPA plans.

5. Specific, concrete and measurable activities to include environmental justice communities should
be a part of all EPA plans. In Montana, the Montana Office of EPA has, de facto, adopted a one size
fits all approach to environmental justice activities. Ways of communicating or including, for example,
non-poor citizens may not work with low income citizens. Yet, the Montana Office makes no special
effort to include environmental justice communities. The one size fits all approach doesn't work when
it comes to environmental justice activities.

6. Certainly, in Montana, there should be training provided to make the Montana Office of EPA more
sensitive to environmental justice issues.

7. The evaluation of all EPA activities should include a specific environmental justice component.

                                                                 1

 Of course, all of the above would only apply if there was an environmental justice community affected
by EPA activities.

I have attached additional comments I would like to submit. One was prepared a while back, as the
remediation plan for Butte Priority Soils was being developed, but, the arguments still apply today.

Please consider these attachments as input and comment on the Draft 2020 Action Agenda

Please accept our organization's support for the Earthjustice comments submitted earlier today. Our
organization represents a vulnerable and disproportionately impacted community in rural Missouri near one of
the nation's largest mercury, SO2 and particulate matter polluters. The Labadie Plant is the largest coal-fired
power plant in Missouri. It has no scrubbers. It has an unlined ash pond which has been leaking for decases and
will now have a large coal ash landfill in the floodplain endangering local groundwater resources.

The plant has operated in our backyard since 1973. Our county carries a heavier burden of cancer,
cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases and respiratory diseases and the power plant is by far the largest
source of environmental pollution.

Generations have grown up exposed to elevated air pollutants and potential water pollution. We are depending
on state, regional and federal regulators to expand enforcement and provide meaningful and interactive
opportunities for our community to assist in identifying risks and reporting data that can be used to better
regulate the industry. The EPA's EJ agenda implementation creates community partners but is only as good as
the outreach, education, reporting tools and attainment measurements put in place. Please see recommendations
outlined in the Earthjustice comments.

Thank you for accepting my brief comments on behalf of my neighbors and our organization. We look forward
to seeing the final framework and to working more closely with EPA in protecting our communities and the
environment.

Communities can do so much more to assist regulators. Give us that chance.

Sincerely,

Mr.Lee,

My name is Amanda. I am a concerned citizen and a residential counselor for adjudicated youth.
I agree with the Human Rights Defense Center position that prisoner populations should be seriously considered
in the EJ 2020 process. It is time to stop treating prisoners like second-class citizens.
As I see every day in my work, those most likely to be imprisoned are people of color and people from low-
income families. The environmental injustice in working class neighborhoods that already exists is inexcusable.
In order to truly examine potential impacts, you must consider who the people in prison are and what risks they
have already faced.

Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters have clearly shown the prison system's lack of preparedness for
such emergencies. Any and all proposed projects involving or in the vicinity of prisons should have
contemporary and dynamic safety and evacuation plans.
Prisoner populations should be seriously considered in the EJ 2020 process. Inmates are human beings that
deserve a healthy environment.
Thank you for reading. Please do what is right.
Amanda St.Martin

Dear EPA,

Reading through the draft framework, I am heartened at the thought put into inclusive strategy and community
building. I would like to urge the EPA to think of a quote that truly embodies the spirit of working in solidarity
with communities.
“If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. If you have come because your liberation is bound up
with mine, then let us work together.” Lilla Watson

I was reminded of this quite as I specifically read the following line from the draft agenda (Sec. II C) as it seems
to insinuate an “us v. them” approach when in reality, issues of environmental justice affect us all. The success,
health, and happiness of overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities is predicate on
our systems and institutions not only create agendas and strategy with the intention of holistic approach but
truly embodying it.

“Promote holistic strategies that meet communities where they are and help them to achieve health,
sustainability, economic opportunity, revitalization and resilience.”

I also want to urge the EPA to think from a community based strategic approach. This is to say that to create
regulations, programs, and policy that is meant to support community success, it needs to come from the
community or the grass roots NOT from a grasstop down approach. I’d also like to urge the EPA to continue to
think on how to engage the immigrant and refugee communities as well as I don’t see any language specifically
recognizing this community.

Thank you for your time,

Lylianna Allala

Thank you again to the ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE and particularly for allowing and including the average
everyday people the opportunity to comment.
It is both important and very appreciated.

A.) I think, or recommend that the EJ Division and the organizations that are involved with EJ, needs to include
some sort of MARKER SYSTEM f the SUPER FUND and Non-Priority SUPER FUND SITES, similar to the National
Register of Historic Places - so that the people in our communities, what's left of them can know that regular folks
like Chicago's Hazel JOHNSON arose to the occasion to help her community and thereby STRENGTHENED the
HUMANITARIAN Conscience f our government (local, state and federal). People like her and others should NOT be
forgotten.

B.) As is true, that former president NIXON'S Administration as, I understand help to implement the EPA and those
with different persuasion need to be reminded ""THOUGHT LEADERS"" may be a newer term used today, however-
AMERICA is greater because of visionary decision-makers.

C.) And the inclusion of support for those in communities who arrive to inquire / complain / interrogative = about
TOXIC WASTE matters should not be just thrown into the land of the UNKNOWN and be retaliated, vindictively by
local, state and other decision makers who are resistant to helping.

Thank you for these thoughts,

Marvin S. Robinson, II

Dear EPA admin,

The Good Force be with you!

The Draft EJ2020 Action Agenda Framework must conform to God's plan which is Paradise Regained ( e.g.
Planting more Paradise Garden Flowers on parks & recreational areas, planting of fruit‐bearing trees on
uncultivated lands, a sustainable cleaner protected environment, free water of life & more...). By doing these,
we are going to have a safer & abundant environment for us & for our children's future.

Live forever & prosper! Alleluia! Amen!

Truly yours,
Melvin ""Yahweh"" M. Lusterio

 animal units in the state of Wisconsin. See Petition for Emergency Action Pursuant to the Safe
Drinking Water Act, from Midwest Environmental Defense Council et al to the EPA, October
22, 2014, at 4. These CAFOs have become a substantial risk to public health in Kewaunee
County as manure contaminates the groundwater with nitrates and bacteria like E. coli. See id., at
7-22.

Although local authorities have failed to protect Kewaunee County’s water, the EPA’s
environmental justice mission can make the difference that state authorities have not. Under the
Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA), the EPA has the authority to pursue a wide range of remedies
to protect public health, such as orders to modify manure application processes, modify waste
storage practices, or halt the disposal of pollutants contributing to the public health risk. See EPA
Memorandum, Final Guidance on Emergency Authority under Section 1431 of the Safe Drinking
Water Act (Sept. 27, 1991). In 2014, MEA partnered with Kewaunee County citizens and
activists to petition the EPA to use its SDWA authority to protect Kewaunee County’s water and
health. Cases like Kewaunee County show the powerful potential of the EPA’s commitment to
environmental justice principles.

II.     By strengthening the EPA’s commitment to working with Native partners, EJ 2020
        can lead to more robust protection for tribal nations and surrounding non-Native
        communities.

A key part of the EJ 2020 framework is the effort to strengthen the EPA’s relationship with tribal
nations. The draft framework calls for a commitment to the well-being of “overburdened
communities,” including Native communities, and repeatedly lists tribal nations as an important
partner for EPA action. See EJ 2020 Draft Framework at 2-3.

A renewed focus on the environmental well-being of tribal nations would be particularly
meaningful in Wisconsin, where Native nations have repeatedly faced threats to their water, their
health, and their economies. Most recently, a proposed swine CAFO in Northern Wisconsin
would house over 26,000 swine near the shores of Lake Superior. Lee Bergquist, Proposed Hog
Megafarm Causes a Stir in Bayfield County, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL, June 27,
2015. Many residents, particularly local tribes, raised concerns about the impact this proposed
CAFO would have on the drinking water, specifically citing the potential for algae blooms from
phosphorus runoff. Id.

Citing tribal concerns about the size of the CAFO and its proximity to drinking water, the EPA
agreed to review the draft permit for the proposed CAFO. This review is an example of how an
environmental justice framework translates to tangible results. By listening to tribes, and
centering Native communities in the analysis of environmental justice, the EPA is taking action
to protect Wisconsin water and Wisconsin communities. Making this framework central to our
analysis will lead to a sharper focus and quicker action on the environmental threats that
communities like Wisconsin tribes face.

 MEA thanks the EPA for the opportunity to comment on EJ 2020. MEA supports the principles

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on EPA’s draft EJ 2020 Framework.

As Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner John Stine stated in his post to EPA’s EJ in Action Blog, addressing
inequities so that all citizens can pursue health and fulfilling lives is one of our most important jobs in public
service. EPA’s strong leadership is important and has been influential in helping to strengthen complementary efforts in
Minnesota.

The MPCA is very supportive of EJ 2020 overall and in particular the framework’s emphasis on collaboration with states
and other co‐regulators. We believe that this will help to further strengthen our individual efforts and our joint work
with EPA. While we share many of the same goals, we bring different strengths and resources to bear that complement
each other.

With respect to Goal II. “Collaborate with partners to expand out impact within overburdened communities,” I would
like to acknowledge the benefit of guidance documents, best practices and tools that support our state efforts to
integrate environmental justice into our work and recommend that EPA continue to expand on tools that can facilitate
more comprehensive and deeper work to reduce disparities in exposures, access, health and livability.

I look forward to working with EPA colleagues on this challenge.

                          Re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework Comment Letter

Dear Mr. Lee:

        The Moving Forward Network (the Network) thanks the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) for the opportunity to provide comments on EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Framework, and
for extending the deadline for us to do so. We also thank you for providing a webinar on the
Draft EJ 2020 Framework to our members, and for EPA’s recent release of EJ Screen—an
important tool for identifying localized cumulative impacts.

        The Moving Forward Network is a national coalition of community-based organizations,
advocates, scientists, researchers, faith-based organizations, and others committed to reducing
the public health harms our country’s freight transportation system creates. The Network is
comprised of approximately 38 organizations and academics in 18 states, including New York,
New Jersey, California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas, where large ports, rail yards and other freight
corridors reside. Importantly, Network members include individuals who live in and work
directly with environmental justice communities. Accordingly, the Network has a personal stake
in how EPA develops its EJ 2020 plan, and makes the following recommendations:

    1. EJ 2020 should identify reducing air pollution from the national freight
       transportation system (e.g., ports, rail yards, busy truck corridors and distribution
       centers) as a top priority

       The Draft Framework (section III.C) requests input on “critical nationwide program areas
that matter to overburdened communities on which [EPA] should focus national attention.”
Freight-related air pollution meets this standard. Diesel emissions from our freight system
present a national environmental justice crisis.

       Nearly a decade ago, EPA recognized that more than 13 million people (3.5 million of
whom are children) live near major marine ports or rail yards, and that these individuals are
disproportionately low-income communities of color and susceptible to increased health risks

from air pollution.1 These figures do not include the approximately 45 million individuals who
live within 300 feet of a highway2 or close to large distribution centers where diesel emission
sources congregate. Moreover, these facilities and corridors are expected to expand in the
coming decades, potentially affecting even more individuals, and contributing to violations of
clean air standards and creating toxic hot spots. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates
that “imports [are] expected to grow more than fourfold and exports expected to grow more than
sevenfold over the next 30 years.”3 Ports and industries are investing billions to expand their
infrastructure to accommodate this expected growth.4

       Conventional cargo movement relies on diesel powered ships, trucks and trains that emit
dangerous particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides, exposure to which results in a wide range
of adverse health effects, including increased rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease, heart

attacks, strokes, premature death, low birth weight, and premature birth.5 In June 2012, the
International Agency for Research on Cancer, a part of the World Health Organization, classified
diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans after determining that there was “sufficient
evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer.”6 Moreover, major
freight operations are happening in counties that already violate federal clean air standards. The
American Association of Port Authorities has identified nearly 40 U.S. ports that reside in
counties that are in non-attainment of federal ozone and PM 2.5 standards.7

        In addition to posing a nationwide environmental justice problem, air pollution from
freight operations would greatly benefit from comprehensive national solutions. EPA is uniquely
positioned to adopt standards that will benefit all communities near freight facilities.
Furthermore, while some states and ports have undertaken meaningful diesel reduction measures,
emissions standards for heavy duty trucks, marine vessels and locomotives often remain outside
the legal authority of states and ports. National standards, therefore, are critical to achieving

demonstrable improvements in air quality across the entire country and throughout the national
freight system.

    2. EPA can achieve its EJ 2020 Framework goals by identifying freight-related air
       pollution as a top priority and undertaking specific actions to curb those emissions

        The Draft Framework articulates the following three goals: (1) deepen environmental
justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and environment of overburdened
communities; (2) collaborate with partners to expand our impact within overburdened
communities; and (3) demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened
communities. The Network supports each of these goals. The following actions will help EPA
achieve each of them within the context of reducing air pollution from the freight transportation
system;
    • After identifying freight-related air pollution as a priority in EJ 2020, EPA should direct
        each of its ten regions to identify and prioritize actions in communities maximally
        exposed to or affected by goods movement-related facilities and activities. EPA’s EJ
        Screen, a review of recent scientific literature on diesel exhaust, and collaboration with
        community partners will be key to this process.
    • EPA should foster regular meetings in each region with environmental justice
        communities adversely affected by freight-related air pollution, and identify short-term
        and long-term goals that address the unique needs of each community while aiming to
        clean-up the freight system as a whole.
    • EPA should expeditiously begin the rulemaking process for regulations that will directly
        reduce emissions from goods movement sources, including but not limited to new engine
        standards for locomotives, heavy-duty trucks, ocean-going vessels and cruise ship
        terminals. These standards should require the development and widespread use of zero-
        emission technologies.
    • EPA should ensure states are effectively addressing freight pollution in their state
        implementation plans (SIPs). In non-attainment regions heavily impacted by freight
        emissions, EPA must ensure that SIPs include all reasonably available control measures
        for freight sources.
    • EPA should issue guidance on diesel emission reduction measures for freight sources to
        facilitate the development and use of zero-emission technologies, and underscore the
        importance of reducing such emissions in connection with addressing pollution in
        nonattainment areas.
    • EPA should advocate for environmental justice, mitigation and transparency in the
        permitting process (e.g., NEPA process) for major freight infrastructure projects,
        especially for those projects proposed in communities identified as already
        disproportionately impacted by freight and/or in nonattainment areas.

        Over the course of the next year, the Network will be expanding upon each of these
recommendations because of the vital importance of these public health threats facing millions
throughout the nation. Our hope is to forge a long-term partnership with the Agency to tackle
freight pollution once and for all. EJ 2020 provides a ripe opportunity to solidify this
partnership.

Charles Lee
Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice
Environmental Protection Agency
Office of Environmental Justice (2201-A)
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20460

Dear Mr. Lee:

The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) is writing to provide
comment on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Justice 2020 Action Agenda
Framework. NACCHO represents the nation's 2,800 local governmental health departments.
These city, county, metropolitan, district, and tribal departments work every day to protect and
promote the health and well-being of all people in their communities.

NACCHO appreciates the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) work to protect the health
and environment of environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed
communities, as stated in the Environmental Justice (EJ) 2020 Action Agenda Framework.
NACCHO recommends the following in response to the EPA EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework:

    1. A uniform community assessment process should be integrated into the framework.
       The framework should integrate more community engagement during the initial scoping
       stages of a project to help produce tangible action items and solutions that reflect the
       priorities of affected communities. Community engagement is especially crucial in
       federal projects to ensure integration of local and community priorities. A uniform
       community assessment process, such as the Protocol for Assessing Community
       Excellence in Environmental Health (PACE-EH), is recommended. The PACE-EH process is
       designed to improve decision making by taking a collaborative community-based
       approach to generating an action plan that is based on a set of priorities that reflect
       both an accurate assessment of local environmental health status and an understanding
       of community values and priorities. The philosophy and methodology offered in PACE-
       EH incorporates the notion that environmental health is protected and improved most
       effectively when it is defined, understood, and acted upon locally.

    2. The framework should include on-going mandatory training in environmental justice
       practice for all employees agency-wide.
       To achieve the intended goals of the EPA EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, it is
       important to ensure that mandatory training in environmental justice practice for all




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                      212
         employees agency-wide is provided on an on-going basis. On-going training will ensure
        that the future workforce will be well-trained in environmental justice and culturally
        competent to work with diverse communities. Cultural competency is a core domain of
        the Core Competencies for Public Health Professionals. The Core Competencies reflect
        foundational skills desirable for professionals engaging in the practice, education, and
        research of public health and help strengthen the public health workforce.

    3. The framework should include language about mandating environmental justice
       decision-making at the local, state, and national levels to be public and transparent to
       affected communities.
       Environmental justice decision-making at the local, state, and national levels should be
       made public and transparent to affected communities so that analysis of potential
       health impacts of policies and activities throughout the process is understood,
       minimized, and equitably distributed.

NACCHO appreciates the opportunity to comment on the EPA EJ 2020 Action Agenda
Framework. As an essential governmental public health partner, we look forward to continuing
to work with EPA to realize the goals of the framework. NACCHO’s Environmental Health
Committee convenes monthly and would welcome the opportunity to engage in dialogue with
EPA leadership on the framework. If you have any questions, please contact Jennifer Li, Director
of Environmental Health, for further information at 202-507-4242 or jli@naccho.org.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Lee,

On behalf of American Rivers’ 200,000 members and supporters across the nation, I am writing
to express our support and gratitude for EPA’s leadership in pursuing and implementing a
strong environmental justice agenda as described in both your EJ2014 and EJ2020 plans. We
agree with EPA’s strategy of addressing environmental justice through both national policies
and local practices within overburdened communities.

Historically, economically disadvantaged communities, particularly those with minority
populations (referred to hereafter as environmental justice communities), have shouldered a
disproportionate amount of society’s environmental liabilities such as highways, power plants,
and combined sewer overflows. The concentration of these burdens in these environmental
justice communities negatively impacts residents and their quality of life. These same
environmental threats degrade communities’ rivers and streams, often transforming them from
community assets - fishing and swimming destinations - into dangerous, polluted hazards.

Climate change is already dramatically impacting our nation’s freshwater resources.
Projections forecast more extremes in weather, both floods and droughts, which are predicted
to have a disproportionate impact on environmental justice communities. American Rivers
works in these communities which already are experiencing more frequent and extreme
weather, resulting in combined sewer overflows, localized flooding, and associated quality of
life impacts. These communities would benefit from more resources to support restoration of
natural, more resilient hydrology.

In the EJ2020 framework, green infrastructure should be included as a tool not only to improve
the quality of rivers by reducing stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, and local flooding but also
to improve the overall quality of life in the community. Green infrastructure adds green space
to otherwise gray, impervious areas, beautifies neighborhoods, reduces noise pollution,
reduces the urban heat island effect, provides space for recreation, and helps bring the




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                        20
 community together. The plants in the greenspace are able to uptake nitrogen dioxide, ozone,
sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, which improves the surrounding air quality. The
implementation and maintenance of green infrastructure in communities can also improve the
local economy by providing jobs for residents (as opposed to big infrastructure projects that
usually go to specialized companies and workers outside of the community).

The EJ2020 framework should allocate funding for clean water infrastructure in order to reduce
sewer overflows and local flooding, particularly in environmental justice communities.
Additionally, funding for this work should be provided in a way that does not cause water rates
to rise significantly in communities that can least afford it.

We encourage EPA to consider actively engaging in furthering work to restore and protect
environmental justice communities as part of climate change adaptation efforts. We also
encourage EPA to provide resources to environmental justice community groups to support the
work of restoring and protecting neighborhood waterways.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding the above comments. I thank you in
advance for EPA’s consideration of these important matters.

Sincerely,




Wm. Robert Irvin
President and CEO

                      Dear Mr. Lee:

                      The National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) appreciates this
                      opportunity to provide comments on EPA’s draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework.
                      NACWA is the advocacy voice for the nation’s publicly owned wastewater and
                      stormwater utilities, and our nearly 300 utility members nationwide are working on
                      the front lines of environmental protection every day to ensure clean water. On
                      behalf of our members, we are pleased to provide this vital municipal perspective on
                      the draft Framework and environmental justice (EJ) issues in general.

                      NACWA members are committed to advancing EJ, and many are already including EJ
                      considerations in how they manage their utilities and interact with their
                      communities. This is especially true regarding low income and economically
                      disadvantaged populations within their service areas. Utilities are also actively
                      embracing EJ as a central component of the Utility of the Future concept, which is a
                      blueprint created by the municipal clean water community to encourage more
                      innovative thinking about how utilities serve their communities. NACWA is
                      supportive of EPA’s EJ efforts and applauds the Agency for proposing the draft EJ
                      2020 Framework. However, NACWA believes the Framework – and EPA’s EJ efforts
                      overall – must include a greater focus on the very significant financial capability and
                      affordability challenges that communities all across the nation are facing, especially
                      low-income urban populations.

                      Clean water and stormwater utilities will be required to spend hundreds of billions of
                      dollars in the coming decades to address a variety of clean water challenges
                      associated with wet weather, nutrients, biosolids management, and stricter water
                      quality standards. These expenditures are the direct result of federal environmental
                      mandates under the Clean Water Act (CWA), often implemented as part of federal
                      consent decrees or enforcement orders. In addition, utilities have an obligation to
                      operate and maintain current assets – e.g., the necessity to maintain, replace and
                      upgrade existing infrastructure. These costs are not discretionary as they reflect the

cost of doing business for a utility. As a result, many utilities – especially those with large EJ populations – are
finding it difficult to afford the increased water and sewer rates necessitated by their existing obligations
coupled with new environmental mandates. This is particularly true in the wake of the Great Recession, from
which many communities are still struggling to recover economically.

NACWA raised similar points with EPA in our 2010 comments on the Agency’s draft Plan EJ 2014. Our
concerns remain as valid today as they were then. However, since 2010, a number of NACWA members have
conducted extensive demographic and economic surveys of their service areas and now have much better data
to quantify the disproportionate impact that rate increases required by CWA mandates are having on
economically distressed EJ populations.

These studies have demonstrated that clean water rates as a percentage of median household income (MHI) –
which is the indicator EPA looks at to determine affordability – can vary widely among segments or individual
communities in a given service area. For instance, one set of data suggested that, while the percentage of MHI
for monthly clean water bills in the top income quintile could range between .74% and 2.98%, the range for the
same bill in the bottom income quintile was between 2.60% and 10.42% of MHI. That is a significant and very
concerning difference in affordability between the top and bottom income brackets, and highlights the
disproportionate economic burdens being placed on economically distressed communities.

NACWA raises this affordability concern not as an excuse to avoid making needed clean water investments, but
instead to emphasize the unfortunate but all too real flip side of federal clean water mandates that many
communities are struggling to address. On the one hand, EPA has indicated the regulatory and enforcement
CWA requirements being imposed on many communities are in part to address environmental concerns
disproportionately impacting EJ populations. But on the other hand, it is those very same EJ populations that
are most often economically distressed and least able to afford the significant rate increases that follow, bearing
a disproportionate percentage of the cost for the overall community.

This is a contradiction with respect to EJ priorities that, NACWA respectfully submits, EPA has not yet resolved.
While EPA has taken important and very helpful steps in recent years to provide communities more flexibility
in meeting CWA requirements through the Integrated Planning Framework and related Financial Capability
Framework – for which NACWA is grateful and applauds the Agency – more work must be done in recognizing
the EJ considerations involved in financial capability and affordability issues. This is particularly true with
respect to requirements around federal consent decrees, which are more often than not the largest single drivers
of large-scale, costly investments by clean water utilities.

Specific to the draft EJ 2020 Framework, NACWA suggests two targeted changes that could more directly
incorporate concepts of community financial capability and affordability in the document without altering its
overall intent. First, NACWA recommends that the first goal of the Framework be expanded to read as follows:
“Deepen environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and environment of
overburdened communities in a manner that recognizes the financial challenges facing economically distressed
populations.” (New language in italics). Similarly, NACWA suggests the first bullet under subsection C of the
first goal be reworded as follows: “Continue to advance environmental justice goals comprehensively through
targeting, case development, and resolution of compliance and enforcement actions in overburdened

communities, taking into account financial capability and affordability challenges facing low-income and economically
distressed populations.”

Beyond the Framework, NACWA encourages EPA to pursue additional efforts to include financial capability and
affordability concerns for low income populations in the Agency’s EJ efforts, especially those created by EPA’s
own clean water environmental mandates to local governments. As part of this effort, NACWA strongly
suggests EPA include a representative from the municipal clean water utility community on the National
Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC). Having an individual from this key stakeholder group on
the NEJAC would provide the council with valuable insights from the municipal clean water sector. NACWA
has nominated a number of its members for seats on the NEJAC in recent years, and is hopeful a municipal
utility representative can be seated on the NEJAC soon.

NACWA appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments on the draft EJ 2020 Framework and
appreciates EPA’s effort on EJ issues. If you have any questions about these comments or would like to discuss
them further, please don’t hesitate to contact me at ngardner-andrews@nacwa.org or 202/833-3692.

 Specific Guidance for States on Incorporation of EJ Principles in Federal Programs

The Framework’s focus is primarily on deepening the practice of EJ within the EPA programs and
offices, and only one section of the Framework addresses EPA’s efforts to have other governments
follow the EJ principles. This is a shortcoming because the Framework does not recognize that
most of the implementation of federal environmental laws is done by the States and by Tribes who
have been granted “Treatment as a State” (TAS). We believe that those federal programs that EPA
has approved for other governments to administer should be required to follow the same EJ
principles that EPA would follow if EPA were to administer the program through direct
implementation.

Section II.A is on the topic “Collaborate with states, Tribes, local governments and other co-
regulators to share and develop environmental justice tools and practices.” This section of the
Framework expects that collaborating, engaging in joint learning, and sharing with states, Tribes,
and local governments will enhance how those governments integrate EJ into how they administer
their programs. We believe that EPA should take stronger steps to ensure that the federal programs
it approves to be administered by the states and other government partners include clear
requirements to meet the same goals and principles of EJ as EPA follows. By doing so, the agency
can ensure that the Framework indeed meets the stated objective to “advance environmental justice
through [EPA’s] programs, policies, and activities.”

It is clear that EPA is responsible for administering all of the federal environmental laws nationally
unless a state or Tribe submits a program that meets the federal laws’ requirements and EPA’s
standards and regulations or is more stringent. There are some federal programs that cannot be
delegated to the states, such as setting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) under
the Clean Air Act (CAA), which are promulgated by EPA. The CAA requires states to designate
air quality control regions and submit state implementation plans (SIPs) that are designed to meet or
exceed all of the NAAQS and other air quality management requirements that EPA has
promulgated.1 If a state submits a SIP that is disapproved by EPA, then Section 110(c) of the
CAA2 requires EPA to establish a federal implementation program (FIP) to properly regulate air
quality. The CAA similarly requires EPA to designate air quality areas if the state fails to submit
an approvable plan,3 and for EPA to designate areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable
for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM10) if the state fails to submit an
approvable list.4

If EPA must directly implement these statutory requirements because the partner government fails
to submit an approvable program, EPA will administer the program itself and follow the EJ
principles that it has adopted in its EJ policies. For example, EPA must approve state programs to
issue air quality permits to major stationary sources under Title V of the CAA.5 Issuing appropriate
permits for the construction and operation of major stationary sources of air pollution is an integral

that EPA “Shall promulgate without unreasonable delay such [FIP] provisions as are necessary and appropriate to

 step to attaining or maintaining the air quality goals of an area in which the source will be located
and the air quality in downwind areas and emissions may disproportionately affect EJ populations
near or downwind of the facility. EPA regulations at 40 CFR Part 70 describe all the requirements
of a state program in order for EPA to approve the state’s Title V permit program. If a state
program or a Tribe with TAS has not been granted full approval of its program under 40 CFR 70.4,
then EPA must directly implement Title V under 40 CFR Part 71.6 Again, if EPA must issue
permits under 40 CFR Part 71, it will follow its EJ principles and policies.

So, EPA is ultimately responsible for how the federal environmental statutes and regulations are
administered by the states, and in the absence of an approved state program, EPA will administer
those environmental programs, following the principles of EJ that are part of EPA’s policies and
practices, in accordance with Executive Order 12898. From that perspective, it makes sense that
the state programs administered on behalf of EPA should follow the same EJ principles that EPA
would follow. A state that runs a federally approved program should have an EJ program
(procedures and protocols) that meet the requirements of EPA’s EJ policies, or adopt a process that
meets the objectives of EPA’s EJ policies. It is especially important, in light of the federal
government’s trust responsibility to Native American Tribes, that state programs incorporate the
principles of the 2014 EPA Policy on EJ for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and
Indigenous Peoples when administering a federal statute with a program approved by EPA.

EPA already has regulations in place that govern public participation at 40 CFR Part 25 for certain
programs, and which directs states, interstate, and sub-state agencies how to provide for public
participation in the implementation of certain programs under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Clean Water Act (CWA).
Yet the requirements that EPA has imposed under these regulations do not require the state
agencies to provide for implementation of those programs in a manner that meets the principles of
EPA’s EJ policies or procedures. The CAA provides authorities where EPA could establish a
requirement that a state applying for program approval must show it has a program that meets the
EJ principles in EPA’s EJ policies. For example, Sec. 110(a)(2) of the CAA,7 requires that an
implementation plan can only be approved by EPA if the state shows that it adopted the
requirements “after reasonable notice and public hearing.” Another CAA authority, Sec. 165(a)(2)8
requires that a permit may not be issued by a state to major emitting sources until it has held a
public hearing and provided for submission of written comments. EPA can establish requirements
for applicants under these statutory authorities that would embody EPA’s EJ principles.

The NTAA recommends that EPA make a commitment to evaluate all delegable federal programs
for how those programs could be strengthened by requiring that a state or other government partner
applying to administer the program must include a demonstration of how it will administer the
program in a manner consistent with the principles of EJ that are articulated in EPA’s EJ policies.
One first step is that EPA can amend its public participation rules at 40 CFR Part 25 to provide that
the special attention to Environmental Justice. For example, 40 CFR 25.4(2) directs state, interstate
and sub-state agencies to identify segments of the public likely to be affected by agency decisions.
It would be appropriate for EPA to also specifically identify environmental justice populations,

 such as Tribes and Indigenous Peoples. Another step that EPA can take for amending Part 25
would be to clearly direct that its requirements apply to many other federal programs which do not
yet have EJ or public participation procedures that embody EJ principles.

Training for EPA Staff in Cultural Competency Principles

In order to meaningfully advance EJ in Tribal communities, EPA staff must fully understand the
cultural dimensions of Tribal lifeways insofar as they relate to unique vulnerabilities and sources of
resilience. Conversely, it is imperative that Tribal partners understand the procedures and workings
of the EPA as it administers and oversees the implementation of federal environmental laws. The
Framework notes that in 2014, EPA staff completed mandatory EJ training. NTAA applauds EPA
for developing mandatory EJ trainings and would strongly encourage an extension of this training
to encompass cross-cultural competency for EPA staff working with Tribal communities.

In 2013 the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) submitted
recommendations to EPA in response to the Working Draft of the “EPA Policy on Environmental
Justice for Tribes and Indigenous Peoples”. Subsequently in 2014, EPA Administrator Gina
McCarthy issued the finalized EPA “Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally
Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples”. The NEJAC recommendations had included an
amendment to Principle 79 which would serve to improve the Policy by promoting effective cross-
cultural competency. NEJAC stated that “outreach and training of Tribes and indigenous
stakeholders to enhance their understanding of EPA’s roles, responsibilities, and corporate culture
is needed.” It is unclear whether the NEJAC recommendations ultimately informed the subsequent
or final iterations of the Policy. Nonetheless, NTAA agrees that if Tribes are meant to fully and
successfully participate in EPA processes related to environmental justice, they must be given an
opportunity for training on EPA culture. In turn, EPA staff training in Tribal culture competence
must be incentivized and encouraged. The benefits of effective cross-cultural competence training
will rapidly become apparent as EPA staff and their Tribal counterparts are tasked complex issues
that arise from the unique cultural practices and customs of tribes and the way that these practices
may influence susceptibility to harm from environmental degradation (e.g. reliance on specific
pollutant-sensitive plant species for traditional practices; consumption patterns of fish that are
unsuitable for high rates of consumption due to contamination).

Cross-cultural competence should include guidance on fundamentals of identifying and interacting
with Tribal communities (e.g. indigenous peoples from outside of the United States), and methods
of identifying culturally relevant information when dealing with Tribes. NTAA recommends that
EPA staff work with Tribal leaders to finalize what specific culturally-relevant material should be
included within cultural competency trainings.

The development of formalized cross-cultural competence training is especially important at this
point in time, when EPA is grappling with high turnover of senior management and staff that

9
  Principle 7 states that: “The EPA considers confidentiality concerns regarding information on sacred sites, cultural
resources, and other traditional knowledge, as permitted by law. The EPA acknowledges that unique situations and
relationships may exist in regard to sacred sites and cultural resources information for federally recognized tribes and
indigenous peoples.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                             220
 possess great institutional knowledge and may have already had longstanding relationships with
Tribes in their respective regions. EPA regional staff, who interact most with Tribal communities,
leadership, and staff would benefit tremendously from well-designed, required cultural competency
training. Similarly, Tribal staff should be afforded the opportunity to participate in cross-cultural
competence training so that they can better understand EPA workings and methods of navigating
through complex Agency processes.

Agency-Wide Commitment to Considering Vulnerabilities/Disproportionate Impacts to
Tribes, Native American and Alaska Natives During the Rulemaking Process

As the EJ 2020 Framework recognizes, it is very important to incorporate environmental justice
into rulemaking. As described in the comments above, one important step is for those rules that
govern what a state or government must include in a federal environmental program for EPA
approval is to demonstrate its program meets the principles of EPA’s EJ policies and guidance. A
second important step is to ensure that EPA’s rule writers and analysts fully consider the EJ
principles while preparing EPA regulations that will be implemented by EPA itself.

We recognize that EPA has been in the process of preparing the Technical Guidance for Assessing
EJ in Regulatory Analyses (Technical Guidance), with the most recent draft issued in 2013. This
can be a very useful guide for EPA rule writers and analysts. However, a brief review of the draft
Guidance finds that it could be updated to fully reflect the principles in EPA’s EJ policies. For
example, while the draft Guidance refers to Indian Tribes in various places, Section 3, Contributors
and Drivers to Potential Environmental Justice Concerns, states “Minority, low-income and
indigenous populations experience greater exposure and disease burdens that can increase their risk
of adverse health effects from environmental stressors.” Minority and Indigenous Populations are
defined in Section 2.2 to include Native American and Native Alaskans among other types of
indigenous peoples. However, Indian Tribes are not often specifically mentioned in the sections
that follow. The Technical Guidance could be updated to specifically refer to the 2014 EPA Policy
on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples,
and ensure that the principles in that EJ policy are incorporated into the Guidance.

Section 3 of the draft Technical Guidance covers the reasons why EJ populations may be
disproportionately susceptible to adverse health effect from exposures, and so the draft Technical
Guidance guides EPA analysts to evaluate the potential health and environmental effects on EJ
populations that could result from the regulations that are being prepared. However, our recent
review of EPA’s proposed rule to revise the ground-level ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS)10 found that the analysts and rule writers had missed an important
disproportionate impact to the health of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, perhaps because the
analysts and rule writers did not have a final Technical Guidance to follow. Native Americans and
Alaska Natives and their children, suffer from the lung disease of asthma at nearly twice the rate of
the general U.S. population. The studies and analyses for the proposed rule identified that ozone
affects a significant number of plant species that are important to Indian Tribes for traditional and
subsistence purposes as well as many other trees and plant species. This information was used to
support lowering the secondary NAAQS to better protect public welfare. However, the
disproportionate effect of ground-level of ozone on the human health of Native Americans due to

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         221
 their higher incidence of asthma was not covered as an important consideration in proposing to
revise the primary NAAQS. For this reason, the NTAA commented on the proposal and asserted
that EPA should adopt the lowest standard reviewed on the proposed rule of 60 ppb, rather than
adopt a standard in the 65-70 ppb range as proposed, in order to provide the greatest protection to
the disproportionately affected Native populations. We noted in our comments that the final section
of the Preamble to the proposed rule that addresses Executive Order 12898 writes that the proposed
action “will not have potential disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental
effects on minority, low-income or indigenous populations because it does not affect the level of
protection provided to human health.” Further on, the proposal writes that the revised ozone
standard will increase public health protection, and cites the Regulatory Impact Analysis as the
basis for that conclusion. While we concur will the science, which suggests that a lower standard
will increase public health protection, we believe that a standard higher than 60 ppb will have a
disproportionate impact on Native Americans and Alaska Natives and their children. We strongly
encouraged EPA to adopt the lowest standard that was discussed in the proposal so as to best
protect the Native American and Native Alaskans who have a higher incidence of asthma than the
general population.

In summary on this point, we urge EPA to finalize the Technical Guidance quickly, incorporating
the suggestions made above. We also urge that EPA ensure that its analysts and rule writers are
fully trained in EPA’s EJ principles and the Technical Guidance, and learn all of the steps that are
to be considered when evaluating the EJ implications of regulations that are being prepared.

Conclusion

The NTAA is pleased to provide the aforementioned comments regarding the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA)’s Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. Please contact us if you

Since	  2010,	  NCA	  has	  been	  Oregon’s	  only	  non-­‐proﬁt	  organizaBon	  dedicated	  to	  reducing	  urban	  air	  
toxics	  and	  other	  air	  polluBon	  that	  puts	  Oregonians’	  health	  at	  risk.	  	  While	  Oregon	  is	  generally	  
perceived	  as	  having	  clean	  air,	  naBonal	  and	  state	  data	  put	  our	  city	  in	  the	  highest	  risk	  category	  for	  
Hazardous	  Air	  Pollutants,	  the	  188	  air	  toxics	  that	  are	  emiNed	  by	  industry,	  diesel	  engines,	  and	  
motor	  vehicles.	  These	  are	  known	  to	  cause	  many	  adverse	  health	  eﬀects	  like	  cancer,	  heart	  disease,	  
upper	  respiratory	  problems,	  and	  asthma.	  	  	  

A	  study	  released	  in	  2010	  by	  the	  Oregon	  Department	  of	  Environmental	  Quality	  showed	  that	  
higher	  concentraBons	  of	  air	  polluBon	  are	  present	  in	  Portland	  Metro	  area	  census	  tract	  with

Health	  Department’s	  2014	  report	  on	  racial	  and	  ethnic	  health	  dispariBes	  in	  the	  region,	  found	  that	  
census	  tracts	  that	  had	  at	  least	  15%	  of	  total	  tract	  populaBon	  idenBfying	  as	  Black/African	  
American,	  Asian/Paciﬁc	  Islander,	  or	  LaBno	  had	  an	  esBmated	  two	  to	  three	  Bmes	  higher	  median	  
levels	  of	  diesel	  parBculate	  maNer	  than	  census	  tracts	  with	  90%	  or	  more	  non-­‐LaBno	  White	  
populaBons.	  	  County	  data	  also	  notes	  that	  these	  same	  populaBons	  are	  suﬀering	  higher	  rates	  of	  
disease	  associated	  with	  air	  polluBon	  including:	  asthma,	  cardio	  vascular	  disease,	  pre-­‐term	  births	  
and	  low	  birth	  weights.	  

The	  persistent	  problem	  of	  air	  polluBon	  in	  Portland,	  while	  well	  documented	  by	  state	  regulators,	  is	  
not	  publicly	  well	  understood	  or	  recognized,	  in	  a	  large	  part	  due	  to	  state	  and	  federal	  reliance	  on	  
NAAQS	  standards	  to	  deﬁne	  general	  air	  quality	  in	  a	  region.	  	  NCA	  recognizes	  that	  individuals	  who	  
live	  in	  non-­‐aNainment	  areas	  are	  at	  great	  risk,	  but	  we	  believe	  that	  a	  signiﬁcant	  number	  of	  people	  
in	  the	  US	  sBll	  are	  at	  danger	  from	  air	  polluBon,	  even	  when	  they	  live	  in	  areas	  that	  meet	  NAAQS	  
standards,	  such	  as	  the	  Portland	  Metro	  region.	  	  Many	  of	  these	  people	  live	  in	  hotspots	  and	  urban	  
environments	  with	  signiﬁcant	  levels	  of	  Hazardous	  Air	  Pollutants	  that	  are	  not	  well	  monitored	  or	  
accounted	  for.	  	  	  NCA	  has	  taken	  the	  lead	  on	  educaBng	  community	  members	  and	  leaders	  on	  the	  
sources,	  risks	  and	  soluBons	  to	  the	  most	  dangerous	  air	  polluBon,	  and	  believes	  this	  experience	  can

• EPA should move EJ Screen and C-Ferst beyond modeling and studying and provide clear
  and effective pathways for citizen science to impact decision making. When these
  modeling tools indicate elevated risk for a community, the burden of proof should be
  shifted to sources of air pollution, or local regulators, to prove that emissions do not cause
  excess harm to the health and well-being of people who live in the affected area.

     Introduction

    One of the stated goals in the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework (EJ 2020) is to

    “Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities.” The New

    Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance (NJEJA) agrees that this is a critical goal and

    believes that a specific outcome on which EJ 2020 should focus is achieving a

    measurable reduction in the amount of pollution in communities overburdened with

    pollution and in environmental justice (EJ) communities.1 EJ communities are more

    vulnerable to detrimental health impacts caused by pollution due to troubling

    vulnerabilities associated with race and income in our nation2 and many EJ communities

    are also overburdened communities (see below).



    The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should develop substantive

    policies that will achieve needed reductions in pollution. These comments offer several

    policies developed by NJEJA and its allies that would achieve such reductions and that

    are examples of the types of strategies EPA should adopt or create.



    Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is also briefly discussed as a mechanism that could

    not only protect EJ and overburdened communities from additional pollution but that

    could also be used to reduce existing pollution.

    Outcomes

    One of the primary community outcomes that should be a focus of EJ 2020 is the actual

    reduction of the pollution load borne by EJ and overburdened communities since this

    pollution can have a negative effect on the health of community residents. For example,

    particulate matter air pollution alone has been estimated to cause 200,000 premature

    deaths in the United States every year.4 It is also well known that EJ communities have

    been found to have a disproportionate number of environmental hazards sited in their

    borders5 and to face disproportionate exposures to pollution, particularly air toxics.6

      The NJEJA mission statement reads as follows: “The New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance is an
    alliance of New Jersey-based organizations and individuals working together to identify, prevent, and
    reduce and/or eliminate environmental injustices that exist in communities of color and low-income
    communities. NJEJA will support community efforts to remediate and rebuild impacted neighborhoods,
    using the community’s vision of improvement, through education, advocacy, the review and promulgation
    of public policies, training, and through organizing and technical assistance.”

     EPA must develop strategies that will have a measurable impact on this outcome. Several

    such policies are discussed below.



    Substantive Policies that Reduce Pollution in EJ Communities

    EPA should develop, with the input of the EJ community, policies that will result in a

    measurable reduction in the pollution load of EJ and overburdened communities. While

    EPA has at times emphasized increasing community participation in EPA processes and

    the need for EJ analyses and mapping it has placed less of a priority on creating

    substantive policies that would actually reduce pollution in EJ and overburdened

    communities. For example, while NJEJA applauds the development of EJSCREEN we

    also strongly urge EPA to attach substantive policies to this tool to provide pollution

    protection and reduction for communities.



    Community participation and EJ analyses are necessary but not sufficient to protect

    communities. EPA needs to move beyond them and create policies that will improve the

    quality of life in EJ and overburdened communities by reducing pollution loads. The

    creation of these policies should also be an integral part of EJ 2020.

     Below we provide a description of several policies developed by NJEJA and allies that

    would accomplish this goal and that EPA should adopt and emulate.



    Cumulative Impacts

    The issue of cumulative impacts should receive more attention than is currently given to

    it in Draft EJ 2020. Cumulative impacts, multiple pollutants emitted by multiple sources

    of pollution in a community that combine with social issues to create negative health

    impacts, is a significant issue in many EJ and overburdened communities across the

    country.7 EPA needs to develop a substantive policy that protects EJ and overburdened

    communities from cumulative impacts.



    NJEJA has developed such a policy. The NJEJA strategy would identify EJ and

    overburdened communities and protect them from additional pollution while decreasing

    existing pollution. It would protect neighborhoods from additional pollution by not

    issuing new pollution permits in overburdened and/or EJ communities unless the

    proposed new facility can show it would not increase the amount of pollution emitted in

    the community. It could accomplish this by either demonstrating it would not emit

    pollution or by offsetting existing pollution emissions in that community. The policy

    would reduce existing pollution in the community by not renewing a pollution permit for

    a facility unless it can demonstrate that it will reduce pollution emissions in the

    community. It can show this by either demonstrating that it will reduce its own pollution

     emissions or by offsetting existing pollution emissions in that community. The policy

    would also provide incentives to improve “quality of life” issues in these communities

    such as open space and the availability of fresh, affordable, food. EJ and/or overburdened

    communities could be identified through the use of EJSCREEN or tools similar to

    California’s8 or New Jersey’s9 cumulative impacts screening tools.



    This policy was presented to EPA previously by NJEJA in comments submitted in

    response to an EPA request for suggestions on how to address cumulative impacts. Those

    comments and a short policy memorandum describing the policy are attached.



    Clean Power Plan

    NJEJA; the Center for Earth, Energy and Democracy; WEACT; the Center for Race,

    Poverty and the Environment; the EJ Leadership Forum on Climate Change and their

    allies have all called for the Clean Power Plan to mandate carbon dioxide emissions

    reductions from power plants in and near EJ communities as a way of ensuring these

    communities receive greenhouse gas co-pollutant reductions that will improve their

    health. It would be preferable if co-pollutant reductions were maximized within the

    constraints provided by the carbon dioxide emissions reduction goal, but even if this is

    not the case EJ communities would benefit from the incidental co-pollutant reductions

    that accompany the carbon dioxide emissions reductions. EPA has touted the co-pollutant

    reductions that will be generated by the Clean Power Plan but there is nothing in the

    current version of the proposed rule that guarantees a certain amount of co-pollutant

     reduction will reach EJ communities and no analyses that even estimates how much co-

    pollutant reduction will reach EJ communities.



    If the Clean Power Plan rule mandated emissions reductions in and near EJ communities

    this would reduce the existing air pollution burden on EJ communities and achieve the

    reduction in pollution that we are advocating in these comments. This policy is explained

    in more detail in comments on the Clean Power Plan that were previously submitted by

    NJEJA to EPA. Those comment are attached.



    Title VI

    Title VI of the 1964 Civil rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq, is not, of course, a policy

    to be developed by EPA but an existing law of the United States. It can be used to not

    only address existing disparate pollution burdens associated with race but also to

    affirmatively protect Of Color EJ communities from disproportionate amounts of

    pollution or to ensure that they receive a fair share of environmental benefits. For

    example, several attorneys associated with the EJ community have suggested that Title

    VI could be used as legal justification for mandating emissions reductions for EJ

    communities under the Clean Power Plan. However, Title VI claims have been handled

    poorly by EPA10 and EJ 2020 needs to ensure that EPA fully repairs its ability and

    intention to enforce Title VI.

     Conclusion

    NJEJA urges EPA to make reducing pollution in EJ and overburdened communities an

    outcome that is a focal point of EJ 2020. EJ 2020 should also emphasize developing

    substantive policies that will achieve this outcome and NJEJA is eager to discuss any

    ideas contained in these comments with EPA.

55_New Partners for Community Revitalization.pdf,"June 30, 2015

Charles Lee
Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice
USEPA, Office of Environmental Justice (2201-A)
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20460

Dear Mr. Lee:

New Partners for Community Revitalization (NPCR) is pleased to respond to the Environmental
Protection Agency’s invitation to comment on the Draft Environmental Justice 2020 Action
Agenda Framework.

NPCR was created as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization in 2002. It emerged out of the multi-
year policy debate that surrounded the passage of brownfields legislation in New York State.
NPCR was quick to recognize that low and moderate income neighborhoods and communities
of color were most often and most egregiously burdened with undeveloped and blighted
brownfields and, at the same time, were least likely to have existing organizations with the
expertise and mission to develop programs and policies to address the brownfield remediation
and reuse needs specific to their communities. In brief, seeking Environmental Justice within
the framework of brownfield redevelopment and renewal was a founding goal of NPCR.

NPCR applauds EPA’s recognition of the importance of Environmental Justice through its 2014
Environmental Action Agenda and is greatly encouraged by EPA’s continued commitment to
this need. We are supportive of all the major areas of effort outlined in the 2020 Action
Agenda Framework — clarity about, and sensitivity to, EJ in rulemaking, permitting,
enforcement; improving collaboration among and between public agencies, stakeholders,
businesses and local communities; and defining, collecting and reporting on metrics that are
valid measures of community-level results of environmental remediation and compliance.

However, we are somewhat concerned that the term “brownfields” does not appear in the
Framework except in the list of 2015 priorities, where EPA wished to make “Further efforts to
make equitable development an integral part of EPA’s Smart Growth, Brownfields, and climate
adaption and resilience efforts.”

We respectfully submit that brownfield redevelopment, if properly planned and managed, is a

                                                                                     June 30, 2015
                                                                                            2 of 2



critical and effective means of rectifying a legacy of unjust siting of environmentally risky
facilities at a time when those with little power had little leverage over zoning regulations or
municipal decision-making. We therefore suggest that one area of the framework should be
strengthened by specifying the exact mechanism to ensure that communities are involved in
addressing a fundamental community issue: Environmental Justice in the context of brownfield
redevelopment.

NPCR was a driving force in the passage of New York State’s first brownfield legislation and
successfully advocated for a nation-leading element within that legislation – the New York State
Brownfield Opportunity Areas Program (BOA). BOA provided State funding to local economic
development agencies and community based organizations to assemble and facilitate local
advisory committees with members from all sectors – residents, businesses, stakeholders and
government agencies. BOA planning built consensus for a brownfield redevelopment plan
based on area-wide needs and market potentials as well as community needs and desires -- a
potent combination that attracted the public and private investments needed for area-wide
brownfield revitalization. Community-based planning precedes and in many ways can simplify
the permitting, regulatory and compliance challenges that EPA rightfully recognizes as critical to
address on the path towards obtaining and sustaining environmental justice.

We therefore urge you to include a straightforward recommendation as part of your
Environmental Justice 2020 Action Agenda Framework, perhaps in the context of the
Community Resource Network: “Support the development of community-based, consensus-
driven, area-wide plans for brownfield redevelopment and revitalization.”

Thank you,

             Re:    Comments on Draft EPA Environmental Justice 2020 Action Agenda
                    Framework

To Whom It May Concern:

             The New York City Law Department, on behalf of the City of New York (“City”)
hereby submits the following comments in response to the United States Environmental
Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Draft Environmental Justice 2020 Action Agenda framework1
(“Draft Agenda”), which was issued for public comment on April 15, 2015.

               Recognizing that equity and environmental conditions are inextricably linked; that
a community’s proximity to environmental hazards may translate into poor health, loss of wages,
and diminished quality of life; and that low-income communities have historically been burdened
with a disproportionate share of environmental risk, the City has taken significant steps to make
decisions about facility placement, infrastructure investment, and the allocation of community
benefit funds based on environmental justice concerns. Through One New York: The Plan for a

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       243
 Strong and Just City (“OneNYC”),2 the City had established both substantive and procedural
goals and policies to advance environmental justice and improve the quality of life in low
income communities. See OneNYC at 164. The Draft Agenda complements the City’s
determination to strengthen public participation to ensure that local knowledge and goals are
accounted for in planning and permitting efforts and actions.

               The City supports and welcomes EPA’s efforts to improve its environmental
justice programs and to assess the impact of its actions on individual communities overburdened
by environmental exposures. EPA’s efforts to introduce more transparent, rigorous, and
consistent approaches to integrating environmental justice concerns into its decision-making;
facilitate community and stakeholder involvement in EPA actions; and develop scientific tools to
track progress, will enhance the agency’s efficacy in addition to ensuring that the concerns of all
communities are accounted for.

                EPA has expressed its intent to consider the consequences to environmental
justice resulting from its permit approval and enforcement actions. One way in which EPA may
directly and markedly reduce the burden imposed on environmental justice communities is to
specifically address the impact of increased water and sewer rates. EPA’s embrace of its
Integrated Planning Framework3 and recent work on affordability4 reflect a welcome recognition
of the importance of prioritizing investments in meeting burdensome Clean Water Act regulatory
requirements to achieve the greatest water quality benefits while ensuring that drinking water
and sewer service are affordable to all. Unlike other local services that are funded through
progressive tax structures, water rates in New York – and in most states in the nation – are based
on rate payers’ water use, and therefore increases in water rates to pay for Clean Water Act
compliance measures have a direct and disproportionate effect on low income communities. The
Draft Agenda should explicitly acknowledge the importance of strategic prioritization in
implementing Clean Water Act compliance measures.

               The City also believes that the Draft Agenda would benefit from identifying a
mechanism to distribute printed versions of documents provided to communities via the
“Resources for Communities” web portal and EJSCREEN tool in order to reach communities
without internet and stakeholders who are infrequent internet users, providing greater access to
materials in multiple languages, and developing mobile and social media-based tools for

We recognize that building a democracy that supports human dignity requires partnerships with
people of goodwill in all sectors of society. We recognize that our shared goal of environmental
justice will not and cannot be granted by those who now profit from the exploitation of people of
color and low income people, and that nothing short of self-determination for all people is
needed to bring about environmental sustainability and health for all. These goals are urgent for
the future of our planet because the ability of the wealthy to avoid the immediate consequences
of environmental destruction by displacing them on the poor allows them to recklessly burn
fossil fuel, make war, and destroy the ecosystems that sustain human life.

Environmental injustice in the United States occurs in the context of extreme inequalities in
wealth and power. According to a University of California report, in 2010 the top 1% of the US
population owned 42% of non-home wealth and the top 5% owned 72% of non-home wealth; the
bottom 80% owned less than 5%. Average white non-home wealth was almost 20 times more
than African-American and 70 times more than Latino. These inequities threaten prospects for
democracy and environmental justice.

As part of the federal government, US-EPA is responsive to the interests of campaign
contributors, lobbyists, and members of Congress who vote on EPA’s budget. Despite corporate
public relations efforts to paint EPA as a threat to business, we recognize that part of the
agency’s function is to issue permits that help protect polluters from being held accountable for
damages to health and the environment that disproportionately impact people of color and low
income communities. Like other federal and state regulatory agencies, EPA has close ties with
the industries it regulates and considers their interests more than those of communities that are
negatively impacted by industry practices. While mainstream environmental groups also
influence EPA, they overwhelmingly represent the interests of constituents who do not live in
communities directly impacted by environmental injustice.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       248
 EPA’s EJ2020 Action Agenda Framework must be evaluated in the context of these limitations
on EPA as an institution. We support EJ2020’s goal of influencing the agency’s rulemaking,
permitting and enforcement. We support EJ2020’s goal of enhancing science. We support
efforts to raise the profile of EJ issues within the agency and beyond as a necessary part of
building a movement for change.

At the same time we recognize that EPA’s policies may provide little relief in a government
dominated by corporate interests. EPA does not have the authority to regulate many
environmental threats. Its science is influenced by industry and it funnels public funds through
industry trade associations. These structural limitations impede the agency’s ability to advance
EJ.

For example, since 1997 North Carolina residents have called on the EPA to help relieve them
from exposure to livestock feces and urine in the densest area of hog production in the nation.
Many of these residents did not know the extent of the pork industry’s influence on EPA. While
scientific evidence of the health and environmental damages caused by industrial livestock
production mounted, neighbors continue to suffer from water pollution, toxic gases and particles,
and the stench of animal waste. In 2014 the state re-permitted over 2,000 facilities that collect
hog waste in open pits and spray it into nearby fields, disproportionately located in communities
of color, leading NCEJN to join a civil rights complaint asking EPA to require the state to
implement regulations that would protect approximately one million people who live within
three miles of a re-permitted facility.

How will EPA’s EJ2020 goals impact the outcome of this and other civil rights complaints? If
EJ is a priority for EPA administrators we would expect the strongest action to remedy the
decades-long suffering of people who live beside industrial hog operations that pollute their air
and water, reduce their health and quality of life, and undermine their human dignity. Although
we hope that our complaint will help promote protection of impacted communities in North
Carolina and all over the country, we do not expect EPA to be able to do this alone. The agency
needs powerful and effective community partners that understand the roots of environmental
injustice and are committed to people’s enforcement to be able to achieve its EJ2020 goals.

For this reason we welcome EJ2020’s call to partner with “overburdened communities” as long
as partnerships promote the ability of communities to organize and protect themselves from
environmental injustices perpetrated by coalitions of state and corporate actors. Partnerships that
provide photo opportunities and rhetoric about inclusiveness are harmful if they do not change
the balance of power towards democracy and self-determination for all communities.
Partnerships that only involve a few individuals, without the involvement and mobilization of the
broader communities impacted by environmental injustice, threaten efforts to bring about
environmental justice.

One serious omission from the draft EJ2020 framework is recognition of the role of structural
racism in perpetuating environmental injustice. The term “race” is absent from the document.
How can EPA seriously address environmental civil rights complaints if it avoids discussion of
race, which provides the legal grounds for federal remedies under the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
The profound consequences of hundreds of years of wars against Native Americans, slavery,



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         249
 segregation, voter suppression, and continued exclusion of occupations dominated by people of
color from basic labor protections, are central to understanding and correcting current
environmental injustices. The historical roots of NCEJN’s civil rights complaint are evident in
the overlap of the locations of the industrial hog operations re-permitted in 2014 and the
proportion of the state’s population that was enslaved in 1860.

We ask our EPA partners to recognize the extent to which environmental injustice has been built
into the laws, economics and culture of our country. This means environmental justice is not
attainable without addressing the unfinished business of movements for civil and human rights,
including equal access to education, public services, courts, voting, safe workplaces and
communities free from state violence. Government agencies cannot effectively advance EJ
without promoting movements outside of government that will shift power from corporations
and the state to communities and workers impacted by injustice. In its EJ2020 plan, EPA should
commit to coordinating with popular movements to strengthen their ability to bring about
environmental, social and economic justice. One tool should be a People’s Bill of Rights that
expands and protects the ability of communities impacted by environmental justice to protect
themselves from environmental degradation and lack of access to the resources and amenities
required for public health.

We also recognize that funding from the state, foundations, and other institutions of the wealthy
can coopt and undermine movements for justice. Therefore, we assert that funding alone,
without a fundamental change of commitment, may do more harm than good because it makes
exploited communities dependent on support from institutions that enhance their own power by
restricting those communities’ ability to challenge and change policies that place profits over
human rights and needs. To promote such a change of commitment, EJ2020 should include
plans for educating regulators, scientists, policy makers, the EJ community and the general
public about the racial and economic inequalities that reproduce environmental injustice.

We appreciate EPA’s consideration of these comments. We are happy to provide additional
information.

Sincerely,


Naeema Muhammad, Co-Director, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network

Input to:      EPA's Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
            A LONG-STANDING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE: MAGICO-RELIGIOUS MERCURY CONTAMINATION OF
        CARIBBEAN & LATINO HOUSING AND THE FAILURE OF EPA TO SUBSTANTIVELY ASSESS AND ADDRESS
                                                    IT:

             SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENABLE EPA TO PROTECT VULNERABLE MINORITY COMMUNITIES.



Introduction

The EPA (as well as manifold local, state and federal agencies) has been aware of the environmental health hazard
posed by magico-religious uses of elemental mercury in some Caribbean
and Latino communities in the US mainland and in Puerto Rico for well over two decades, yet EPA has done nothing of a
substantive nature to assess these exposures, and hence has failed
to protect mercury-impacted communities from ongoing exposure to developmentally neurotoxic levels of mercury vapor
in their homes.

The vast majority of these exposures are from mercury vapor emanating from prior ritualistic mercury spills on floors, spills
which continue to evolve developmentally neurotoxic levels of mercury
vapor for several decades; hence most exposures to ritualistic mercury vapor are at second-hand. The occupants of
mercury-contaminated dwellings are unaware of their exposure, as are
their health care providers.

Unlike 'classical' EJ exposures, the source of this extremely neurotoxic contaminant is not some commercial or
governmental entity exogenous to the impacted communities, but rather from
members of the minority communities themselves. These tend to be relatively poor communities, with no ability to pay for
mandated decontamination, and in any event, there is no way to
legally identify the person or persons who ritualistically contaminated the dwelling/s, and hence no way to make the
polluter pay.

                                                                                1
              EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                                               22
 As stated in 'my' two successful EPA R2 Environmental Justice-Pollution Prevention grant applications of 1996 and 1998,
the environmental injustice was (and remains) the failure of government
agencies with oversight of such contamination, and specifically the EPA, to assess, address, and prevent these
environmental exposures to mercury vapor in housing, resulting from its magico-
religious use.


Proposed steps to address the problem

The key to addressing the issue is to demonstrate (or disprove) that housing in Caribbean-Latino
communities is contaminated with mercury as a result of its magico-religious use.
(Please see attached March 1999 ATSDR excerpts.) This is simple and cheap to do using a portable mercury-vapor
analyzer to non-invasively measure mercury levels in the public hallways of a representative sample
of heavily Caribbean-Latino apartment buildings (especially public housing) in communities (Bronx, NY; Union City, &
West New York, NJ; Lawrence, MA) where ritualistic mercury was known to have been sold and used.
Occupants of apartments emitting high levels of vapor would be notified, and requested to allow measurements of the
vapor levels inside their homes. Occupants of contaminated apartments would be tested for
elevated mercury levels and diagnosed for symptoms and signs of mercury poisoning. EPA has a mandate to perform
such research, but to date has refrained from doing so. (Please see the attached 2010 letter and
associated RARE FY 2011 Grant Proposal from EPA R2.) It has long been apparent to all familiar with the problem, that
should this research be carried out, it would almost certainly result in demonstrating that very
large numbers of homes are contaminated, and so would require their evacuation and decontamination, as well as
demonstrating the failure of the environmental health system.

 The utility of mercury vapor filters needs to be assessed, which if placed in mercury-contaminated homes,
would allow their occupants to remain in them until the dwellings could be decontaminated.
(Please see attached mercury vapor filter prospectus.)

Health education programs must be implemented, and based on informing the mercury-exposed communities of
the reality of their mercury exposure and of its effects. The majority are exposed at
second-hand, and are not ritualistic mercury users, and in many cases not of Caribbean or Latino ethnicity. (Please see
attached 2012 JEM Letter.)

Health care providers serving mercury-contaminated communities need to be informed of these
exposures and their clinical picture. This will raise their clinical suspicion and enable
them to diagnose exposures which they are currently missing. Two examples of such attempts
are www.state.nj.us:80/health/eoh/cehsweb/hcp_culturalmercury.html from New Jersey, and
www.mercurypoisoningproject.org/pdf/metallic99.pdf ; www.mercurypoisoningproject.org/pdf/booklet99.pdf from New
York City. EPA should issue requests for proposals from the environmental
medical community to work collaboratively with community organizations to collect data on mercury vapor levels in
housing, mercury levels in occupants of mercury-contaminated housing, and health
effects of these domestic mercury vapor exposures. (Please see attached 2007 JSI EPA report.)

We believe prison populations need to be included in environmental justice

minority, low income and are in need of environmental protection.

             Public Comment re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

Dear Mr. Lee:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework.
PenderWatch & Conservancy (“PenderWatch”) is an all‐volunteer organization founded in 1986
in Pender County, North Carolina as “Responsible Advocates for the Environment.” We have
approximately 400 members. PenderWatch is committed to preserving the natural
environment of Pender County for current and future generations by promoting
environmentally sound policies and programs.

We are grateful for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework for EJ 2020. In
particular, we would like to draw your attention to a pressing need ‐ and excellent opportunity ‐
for EPA to meet its goal to “Engage states and other co‐regulators in environmental justice,”
particularly with regards to permitting, by using the pending NC Division of Air Quality permit
for Carolinas Cement Company as a test case.

Engaging states and other co‐regulators in environmental justice
EPA can meet its over‐arching goal to “make a visible difference for over‐burdened
communities” by addressing the points under Goal I, “Deepen environmental justice practice




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       255
 within EPA programs to improve the health and environment of overburdened communities.”
Nearly every environmental
permit issued is an opportunity to do just that. EPA’s focus on considering environmental
justice in EPA permitting decisions is well‐placed; however, only a tiny fraction of permits are
actually issued by EPA. Most permits are issued by state agencies or tribal governments. Many
of these permitting
staffs issued the very permits that created current Environmental Justice hotspots.
Environmental Justice will not be considered in most environmental permitting decisions unless
EPA strongly supports ‐ or even compels ‐ states to do so. We urge EPA to focus on advancing
the engagement of states in considering and implementing environmental justice:

    ● Require Environmental Justice training for state agency staff members and leaders
        under cooperative agreements
EPA has completed mandatory training on Environmental Justice for all employees, according to
the Plan EJ 2020 Draft Action Agenda Framework. Congratulations on this important
achievement! Many state agency staff are in dire need of training on environmental justice as
well. State agency representatives in North Carolina, and presumably in many other states, are
unclear about what environmental justice is, why it is important, and how to consider or
implement it in their jobs. North Carolina serves as a key example, as it no longer even has a
coordinator for Environmental Justice within the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. We suggest that EPA require all state agency staff involved in permitting and
enforcement to receive mandatory environmental justice training under the terms of their
cooperative agreements with EPA. States like PA, CT and IL, which have shown leadership in
implementing environmental justice principles, could be tapped to help provide these trainings,
so that the message is peer‐to‐peer and thus more likely to be well‐received by states. Such an
approach would also help meet EPA’s goal to “Collaborate with states, tribes, local
governments and other co‐regulators to share and develop environmental justice tools and
practices” (EJ 2020 Draft Framework).

    ● Guide states to consider Environmental Justice and develop hooks that compel them
        to do so
 There are likely multiple barriers that prevent states from considering and implementing
 Environmental Justice in their permitting and regulatory functions. These barriers may include
 a lack of understanding of the principles of environmental justice (see previous bullet point), a
 perceived lack of resources or specialized knowledge to implement environmental justice,
 pressure from regulated entities to speed up regulatory processes in ways that could preclude
 full consideration of environmental justice, or others. EPA should identify and address these
 barriers through education and training, guidance materials, and by compelling states to




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         256
  consider Environmental Justice in permitting and enforcement whenever possible, such as
 under cooperative agreements or other funding mechanisms. For example, EPA could adapt
 the Agency’s guidance “Considering Environmental Justice in Permitting” for state use, and
 provide direct assistance in using such a tool. EPA could require states to make use of the
 guidance as a condition of specific funding / cooperative agreements.

    ● Use the Carolinas Cement Company air permit as a test case under EJ 2020 to move a
       state to thoroughly consider and implement environmental justice principles in a state
       permitting decision.
EPA has an excellent opportunity to help a state make considerable progress by learning hands‐
on how to use the principles of Environmental Justice in permitting. In issuing an air permit to
Carolinas Cement Company in 2013 (a permit that is currently before the North Carolina
Supreme Court), an endeavor that would build one of the world’s largest cement plants in an
over‐burdened community of poor and minority residents on the Northeast Cape Fear River on
the border of Pender County, North Carolina regulators summarily rejected the community’s
many requests to consider environmental justice factors in its permit analysis. PenderWatch
has submitted comments on the proposed permit, and has communicated our concerns about
environmental justice with regards to this permit to NC DENR and to EPA’s Region IV
Environmental Justice staff members.

The NC DENR Division of Air Quality held a public hearing on the revised permit in 2013, at
which PenderWatch, the New Hanover County NAACP and several other community
representatives urged the state to consider the special vulnerabilities of the nearby community
reliant on well water, already overburdened by legacy contamination from present and
historical polluters on the Northeast Cape Fear River. Despite our specific requests to do so, the
Division of Air Quality flatly refused to consider any secondary impacts of the permit, from air
deposition of mercury and heavy metals into an impaired waterway, to the tremendous
increases in heavy truck traffic that would accompany the opening of a massive cement plant.
The hearing officer publicly belittled community members for urging the Division of Air Quality
to consider environmental justice in their permitting decision. From the hearing officer’s
written report:

        “Commenters appear to allege that the federal Environmental Justice policy
        applies to NC DAQ’s issuance of this permit. The federal policy, set forth in Federal
        Executive Order No. 12898, addresses the federal government’s responsibilities
        only, not the State’s. Therefore it is not applicable here.” ‐ NC DENR
        Recommendation for Issuance of Air Quality Permit, Carolinas Cement Company,
        August                                  29,                                     2013

         (http://daq.state.nc.us/permits/psd/docs/titan/CCC_Hearing_Officer_Report.pdf
        , page 13).

The Hearing Officer’s opinion was adopted in its totality and the Carolinas Cement Company air
permit signed by Donald Van der Vaart, who was subsequently appointed Secretary of the
North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
See http://daq.state.nc.us/permits/psd/docs/titan/titan_perm_08292013.pdf

We strongly urge EPA to conduct a thorough review of this permit and use your authority under
the Clean Air Act and other federal laws to give Environmental Justice its due consideration in
this matter. Mr. Lee, we would like to meet with you as well as meet again with Mr. Mustafa
Ali to discuss this proposal. We will contact you separately with a meeting request.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on the EJ 2020 Draft Framework, and for
your diligent work to promote environmental justice. Please contact me at any time for
additional information about the issues which have been raised in this comment letter.

Respectfully yours,

62_Public Employees.pdf,"       EPA’s Environmental Justice Program – Isolated from Civil Rights
               PEER Comments on EPA 2020 Environmental Justice Action Agenda
                                     July 14, 2015

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has invited comment on a “draft EJ 2020
Action Agenda.” These comments by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility
(PEER) contend that this draft EJ 2020 plan continues, and in fact worsens, core flaws that have
weakened and marginalized EPA’s environmental justice program for the past two decades.

The key weaknesses on the draft plan are that it –

     Wrongly separates environmental justice from its underlying basis in the Civil Rights Act
      of 1964;

     Contains no guidance for state and local recipients of EPA funds, leaving the program as
      a an intellectual construct without content; and

     Lacks any planning for enforceable regulation.


    I.     Flunking Civil Rights
By severing environmental justice from civil rights EPA has reduced environmental justice to a
largely voluntary program. As articulated in this plan, environmental justice is aspirational in
nature, with EPA serving mainly in a cheerleading role.

This diminution of environmental justice stands in stark contrast to the core values of the
environmental justice movement itself, coming out of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Before the expression “environmental justice” came into usage, the core issue was clearly named
and understood as environmental racism. Yet over the years EPA has increasingly turned away
from the issues of race and civil rights, to a degree that it is fair to ask whether at EPA
environmental justice has become a distraction from EPA’s obligation to deal with issues of race
and civil rights.

Whatever the motivation, the fact remains that at EPA civil rights has fallen off the
environmental justice table, and among the costs has been the disempowerment of communities
desperately in need of environmental justice and a lessening of their ability to invoke Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in order to obtain that justice. The further isolation of civil rights



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                          259
 from EJ is evident in the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda in its relegation of Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act to a single bullet in a short list of “related efforts” at the tail end of the draft EJ 2020
“Framework.”

This disconnection of EJ from Title VI has left both programs in weaker shape than is needed, at
a time when the programs should be working hand in hand, complementing and reinforcing each
other. Both are in need of attention.

In reality, EPA’s management of these issues actually undermines communities’ civil rights.
Many and perhaps most communities facing environmental discrimination are predominantly
minority. Yet EPA, by withholding the involvement of its Title VI civil rights program and staff,
has effectively neutered the agency’s own capacity for engaging the issues as the civil rights
issues which in fact they are.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act is not only the law of the land, but is a recognized tool for
bringing about environmental justice. Environmental justice and the Civil Rights Act are
intertwined, and have been so since the inception of the environmental justice movement.

Environmental justice was institutionalized at EPA and in the federal government on February
11, 1994, when President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.” In almost every
action addressing environmental justice since then the Agency has cited E.O. 12898 as its basis
for action, including in Plan EJ 2014, issued in 2011. In issuing that Executive order in 1994,
President Clinton accompanied it with a Presidential memorandum, the purpose of which was:

        “…to underscore certain provision of existing law that can help ensure that all
        communities and persons across this Nation live in a safe and healthful environment.
        Environmental and civil rights statutes provide many opportunities to address
        environmental hazards in minority communities and low-income communities.”
        (Emphasis added.)

Having noted that the E.O. is intended “to promote nondiscrimination in Federal programs
substantially affecting human health and the environment,” his memorandum then went on to
direct “that all department and agency heads take appropriate and necessary steps to ensure that
the following specific directives are implemented immediately:” among them the following:

        “In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, each Federal agency shall
        ensure that all programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance that affect
        human health or the environment do not directly, or through contractual or other
        arrangements, use criteria, methods, or practices that discriminate on the basis of race,
        color, or national origin.”

Thus from inception, environmental justice at the federal level and in its foundational Executive
Order 12898 has been intended to work in tandem with the Civil Rights Act, most specifically by
way of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In sum, environmental justice has a basis in law, most
specifically in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              260
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act gains practical traction and consequence in its prohibition of
federal funding for any “recipient” state and local agencies whose programs may have a
discriminatory effect on minority populations. In practice the vast majority of EPA’s programs
are implemented at the state and local level by such “recipient” agencies, and almost every one
of these agencies receives EPA funds. Under the law a “discriminatory” effect includes any
impact resulting from “procedures, criteria or methods” used in those programs that may result in
a disparate or disproportionate impact. It is Title VI which provides the federal government with
powerful role in overseeing hundreds of state and local agencies, and imposing on them an
affirmative obligation to take steps and implement procedures to protect communities from
discriminatory environmental impacts.

Where environmental justice and Title VI overlap is in their shared goal and requirement to
protect communities of color from being subject to disparate or disproportionate impacts.
Environmental justice expands this protection to include low income and other populations, but
the core requirement in law to protect minority communities remains embedded. The relevance
of this to the day-to-day struggles of environmental justice communities is that many, and
perhaps most, such communities have a substantial minority population. Therefore, when a
minority community raises a concern regarding disparate environmental impacts, that concern
can and ought to be addressed as both an environmental justice and a civil rights issue.

While there was little progress on the EJ front during the administration of President Bush
(2001-2008,), there were high expectations when President Obama took office in January 2009.
His appointment of Lisa Jackson as EPA Administrator further kindled hopes for renewed
attention to EJ. By 2010 a multi-year strategy was coming together and was issued in 2011 as
“Plan EJ 2014,” the first ever such plan at EPA.

Significantly, however, a near final draft was almost completely silent on Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act. Then, largely in response to a series of meetings Administrator Jackson had been
holding with the “Title VI Alliance,” a group of about a dozen EJ and civil rights advocates from
across the country, the final Plan EJ 2014 was revised to include more than three dozen
references to Title VI.

By contrast with the 2014 Plan and Title VI Supplement, the EJ 2020 Action Agenda stands out
by way of its almost complete omission of Title VI.

In short, EPA has lost its way on civil rights and environmental justice. The agency has allowed
Title VI to become a “third rail,” too hot to be touched. The EJ 2020 plan needs to touch that rail
if it seeks to have any power.

    II.     Absence of Substantive Guidance
The most fundamental gap in EPA meeting its civil rights and environmental justice
responsibilities is that it has never provided substantive guidance to the hundreds of state and
local “recipient” agencies funded by EPA on how to fulfill their obligations under Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act.




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         261
 Other federal agencies such as the Departments of Transportation (DOT), Education and Health
and Human Services have issued such guidance and followed up with vigorous oversight to
ensure that it is used in practice, in some cases withholding tens of millions of federal dollars
because recipients failed to follow agency guidance.

While EPA has issued procedural Title VI guidance on public involvement, it has not provided
guidance on addressing the substantive issue of actual disparate impacts. It is the lack of this
guidance, more than any other single factor, which has let state and local environmental agencies
off the hook for their obligations under the Civil Rights Act, and left communities vulnerable to
environmental negligence and discrimination.

It is imperative that EPA move immediately to remedy the gap it has allowed to develop between
its environmental justice and civil rights programs, and that steps to address this gap be
incorporated into both EJ 2020 as well as the Civil Rights Office “Strategic Plan” mentioned in
the draft EJ 2020 Framework. This gap exists in many forms, including the Agency’s
organizational structure, policies, programs and day-to-day operations, and must be addressed at
all of these levels. Clearly this will not happen without a clear, credible and sustained
commitment from the EPA Administrator herself.

Without guidance supported by regulations requiring use of that guidance, there will be no right
of redress for environmental injustice. In 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Alexander v.
Sandoval (532 U.S. 275) against the right of private citizens to bring suit under Section 602 of
the Civil Rights Act. This section deals with discriminatory effects or impacts and does not rely
on demonstrations of “intention” to discriminate. The Act’s accompanying Section 601 prohibits
intentional discrimination and under this provision individuals have the right to sue but proving
intentional discrimination is a tall order. If EPA issued binding Title VI guidance for recipients,
and the recipients failed to comply with that guidance, then such failure could be used as
powerful evidence that the discriminatory effects are indeed intentional.

On May 4 of 2015, EPA released a “Title VI Progress Report” in which it once again committed,
as it had in the 2012 Supplement, to issue guidance or a “toolkit” for recipients. What was
lacking, however, was any acknowledgment of, or explanation for, why such a commitment has
been contained in formal Agency every year for each of the past four years, (always for “this
year”) and yet the commitment has never been met. Meanwhile a draft of such guidance has yet
to be circulated by the Office of Civil Rights within the Agency or even at the Office of
Environmental Justice.

Without guidance, EJ will remain a voluntary, aspirational goal with no practical tools for
affected communities to defend themselves.

   III.   No Enforcement, No Progress
The Environmental justice section of the EPA website declares:

             “EJ 2020 is a strategy for advancing environmental justice ... It is not a rule”

That statement encapsulates its limitations.



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         262
 It is no secret either within EPA or among civil rights advocates that other agencies such as
DOT, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), are far ahead of EPA when it comes to
administering their Title VI programs and coordinating between their EJ and Title VI programs.
The FHWA recently released a “Reference Guide” for EJ practitioners at both the agency and at
the state and local agencies receiving FHWA funds. The Guide lays out FHWA’s view of the
relationship between EJ and Title VI, and goes on to describe in practical terms how the
programs should interact in dealing with EJ and Title VI issues that arise in any particular
community.

Beyond the Guide, it is the actual practices of FHWA staff that show how FHWA has taken a
common sense problem-solving approach into communities raising Title VI and EJ issues. EJ
staff at EPA likewise is well aware of, and seen in practice, the DOT’s willingness to work hand
in hand with other federal agencies such as EPA in developing practical solutions to
communities’ Title VI concerns.

This contrasts fundamentally with EPA’s highly legalistic and analytically oriented approach in
which countless hours and staff resources are spent on essentially desk exercises rather than in
pursuit of practical solutions working with the communities and other involved parties.

A look at FHWA’s working definition of what EJ means at that agency may shed light on the
difference between the two agencies. From FHWA’s “Environmental Justice Reference Guide”
(April 1, 2015):

        “Environmental justice at FHWA means identifying and addressing disproportionately
        high and adverse effects of the agency's programs, policies, and activities on minority and
        low-income populations to achieve an equitable distribution of benefits and burdens. This
        includes the full and fair participation by all potentially affected communities in the
        transportation decision-making process.”

By way of contrast consider the opening statement of EPA’s Draft EJ 2020 Framework, also
released in April, 2015:

        “EPA’s environmental justice efforts seek to protect the health and environment of
        overburdened communities, support them to take action to improve their own health and
        environment, and build partnerships to achieve community health and sustainability.”

While the FHWA is making a clearly stated commitment to “identify and address” real situations
on the ground in communities, EPA’s plans to “seek,” “support” and “build partnerships.” Thus,
EPA adopts a passive cheerleading-like approach. This contrasts with FHWA’s clear statement
of who (FHWA) will do the acting, that they will “identify and address” discriminatory
activities, and FHWA’s clear statement that the affected communities are to be involved in
“decision-making.”

Thus, other federal agencies are less confused about EJ and civil rights. It is especially
disconcerting that EPA, the one federal agency tasked with coordinating EJ efforts among all



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         263
 federal agencies, lags so far behind other federal agencies when it comes to carrying out the
requirements of the Civil Rights Act.

Nor does EPA use its traditional enforcement to further EJ goals. For example, in June 2010 the
EPA Office of Inspector General slammed EPA for a decade-long failure to implement national
urban air toxics control plans, designed to alleviate a major public health threat to the nation’s
urban centers with concentrations of disadvantaged populations. (“Key Activities in EPA’s
Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy Remain Unimplemented” Report No. 10-P-0154). The
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required EPA to develop a strategy to reduce air toxics
emissions in urban areas, particularly from small stationary sources. While the agency was
required to issue new urban emissions standards in 2000 for these smaller local sources, such as
cars, dry cleaners and gas stations, EPA failed to follow through. Yet EPA figures show acute
risks from these local sources – potentially causing cancer in one in 28,000 Americans with two
million residents in areas where the lifetime risk was one in 10,000 or greater..

Perhaps more problematic is the delay once again of any action on a previously proposed policy
on the role of environmental standards in resolving Title VI complaints. In looking into Title VI
complaints EPA has long relied on pre-existing environmental standards (such as the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS) as essentially disposing (by way of a “rebuttable
presumption”) of any disparate impact issues. In practice this tends to neutralize Title VI
complaints simply by way of a desk exercise, rather than a real investigation of the root causes of
the complaint at the community level. EPA had proposed changes to this policy nearly three
years ago requiring a closer look at, for instance, localized impacts, but that policy change has
apparently stalled.

Tellingly, EPA has not even come to grips with how it should investigate EJ complaints. An
attempt at developing Title VI investigative guidance fell victim to an EPA management hoping
to deal with discrimination solely as a technical issue that could be resolved with “science.” The
net result was an extremely lengthy, largely incomprehensible and fundamentally unusable
guidance document proposed in 1998, then revised and recirculated as “draft revised” guidance
document in 2000.

EPA has tried to obscure the fact that the guidance was never finalized by referring to it as
“interim” guidance. The document pleased no one and drew a large amount of critical comments
which were never responded to. Regardless, the main underlying flaw in this approach and a
tendency which continues at EPA even now, was in trying to resolve issues that are essentially
policy issues by hoping they could be resolved by “science.” Whether this is due to confusion or
political and managerial timidity remains unclear, but the result is the same – EPA has choked
when it comes to identifying and acting on discriminatory practices.

In summary, it can be fairly said that the pattern at EPA on actually addressing environmental
justice is studded with stalled policies, fragmented efforts and repeated unmet commitments.

Does EPA Have a Race Problem?
There have long been rumblings within EPA that it’s problems in dealing with race outside the
agency in its EJ and Title VI programs are directly related to its still unresolved issues around



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                          264
 race within the agency, issues which as described above, came to a head in the 1990s. The
primary authority for addressing such issues is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. EPA has placed
both the Title VI (“external”) and Title VII (”internal”) programs in the same office. It is hard to
imagine that problems in one program within the office would not have some effect on other
programs in the same office.

Many agency employees feel strongly that fairness outside the agency goes hand in hand with
fairness inside the agency. It is unlikely that the agency would be able to deal effectively with
discrimination outside the agency if it has not been able to deal with it inside the agency. Many
current employees of all ethnicities would say the agency has never addressed, let alone
remedied, its “internal” civil rights issues.

Conclusion
In summary, a real commitment to EJ by EPA would –

       Restore the rightful relationship between civil rights and environmental justice by putting
        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act at the heart of the EJ plan and committing to implement
        the letter of that law fully.

       Issue guidance and supporting regulations directing the hundreds of “recipient” agencies
        to comply with Title VI and protect communities from discriminatory environmental
        effects. This guidance would clearly explain what steps these recipient agencies need to
        take.

       Would look to adopt best practices from other agencies such as the US DOT and FHWA
        for models of EJ and Title VI programs and how they are enforced.

In addition, meaningful progress would require that EPA get its own act together. At a
minimum, the EPA’s civil rights and EJ programs need to learn how to work together towards
common goals. Ideally, it would then incorporate that new-found coordination between the
programs into both the EJ 2020 plan and the Office of Civil Rights Strategic Plan.

Given the mixed, at best, record of EPA on EJ and Title VI thus far, there may not be reasonable
grounds for optimism for meaningful progress during the final 18 months of the Obama
administrator.

Respectfully submitted,


Jeff Ruch
Executive Director.

63_Public Lab.pdf,"Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science comments on EPA EJ 2020 Action
Agenda Framework

Section I. Deepen Environmental Justice practice within EPA programs to improve the
health and environment of overburdened communities

    A. Finalize guidance on considering environmental justice in rulemaking. This is a dense
       comment, it would be helpful to clarify what is meant by this.
    B. Continue to implement regional plans for enhanced public participation. How is
       encouragement happening? We urge you to consider public participation in a wide range
       of activities from permitting to project evaluation and rule making.
    C. Advance environmental justice through compliance and enforcement. Will timeliness of
       enforcement and compliance in disadvantaged communities be addressed? We would
       like to see enforcement in overburdened communities with environmental justice
       infringements fast-tracked.
    D. Enhance science tools for considering environmental justice in decision-making. We
       firmly support the call to advance research on cumulative risks and impacts. We would
       like to see utilization of community-based participatory research and citizen science data
       specifically in EPA’s effort to foster Next Generation compliance. The public can
       contribute to documentation of environmental conditions and identification of
       noncompliance, especially at a screening level. In order to utilize community-collected
       data, EPA-approved methods should be performance-based rather than technology-
       based. Additionally, publicity around Next Generation compliance strategies and tools
       such as ECHO and EJ Legal Tools is necessary for them to be impactful.

Section II. Collaborate with partners to expand our impact with overburdened
communities

    A. Collaborate on tools and mechanisms, such as EJSCREEN and E-Enterprise, we can
       use together to advance environmental justice: Please describe the planned public
       outreach for these tools. In addition to these EPA-developed tools, it would be efficient
       and mutually beneficial to look outward to tools and data produced by the public.
       Promote avenues for tool input. Want them to say something about new tools price point
       that they’ll incorporate into E-Enterprise.

    B. Work with other federal agencies to advance environmental justice through the
       Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice: We would like to see
       environmental justice advanced at all levels, and to do so, we need to enhance
       accountability at the state level. We recommend state and regional partners participate
       in the Working Group in order to facilitate direct communication and promote action.

    C. Support community-driven efforts to identify and address environmental challenges with
       comprehensive roadmap approaches for development and capacity-building. In addition
       to “development and capacity building” this should also include redress.



                                                                                                 1
EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       266
 Section III. Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to overburdened communities

        C. In addition to measuring outcomes in particular communities, invite comment on
        whether there are a few critical nationwide program areas that matter to overburdened
        communities on which we should focus national attention (e.g., drinking water, lead
        paint): We think there are more relevant examples, such as air quality issues and
        household pollutants.

Section IV. Related efforts

    A. Promoting climate adaptation and resilience and greenhouse gas reduction co-benefits
       will be an important part of the EJ 2020 Action Agenda. We support the emphasis on
       climate adaptation and resilience and encourage EPA EJ to emphasize locally relevant
       instances of adaptation, resilience and reduction. An interesting example of how the
       process for public participation in planning for climate adaptation is being led by people
       is with pacific island peoples and their widespread adoption of P3DM (participatory 3D
       modeling). Participation improves outcomes on climate processes and is recommended
       by the National Research Council1.

        Note: We would like to see dedication through EPA EJ to Superfund remediation.

Under 2015 priorities

    -   This list does not include priorities that will address Section I.D: Enhance science tools
        for considering environmental justice in decision-making. We suggest that specific
        actionable steps towards inclusion of priorities be added to support Section I.D.
    -   This point is vague and needs additional clarification: “Conduct community resources
        and training workshop”.

Subject:                         EJ 2020 Open Public Comment



The purpose of this public comment is to emphasize above all else the need to aggressively pursue
your line item, ""Making a Visible Difference in Communities.” Whereas righting past wrongs through
Environmental Justice efforts is definitely important, our energy and other infrastructures as they
stand are working in ways that serve to perpetuate the occurrence of more wrongs. Mitigating future
problems through prevention, by way of reducing exposures of individuals to pollutants,
contaminants, and poisons is the most ethical and efficacious approach to take in addressing health
disparities among individuals living in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically
distressed communities, as they relate to environmental protection.


Individuals living in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities are
exposed to more pollutants from vehicular traffic, than other individuals. Because of the history of land
acquisition before The Civil Rights Movement in this country, many if not most of our highways and interstates
cut through economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Underserved individuals also typically do
the “dangerous” or “dirty” work, such as directly handling gas. Much of the work that involves using gas-
powered equipment day in, and day out, such as landscape and construction equipment with gas engines, is
work that confers lesser pay, thereby relegating individuals to earn less while being persistently exposed to
noxious pollutants. People with older cars tend to be economically distressed, which means their own exhaust
can leak into the cabin of their car, and their emissions are dramatically worse than those from a car owned by
someone with the financial means to maintain it properly. People without garages or carports tend to be
economically distressed. Weathering from the elements wears the gaskets / sealants that seal car cabins, making
these individuals more susceptible to leakage of vehicular pollutants from other vehicles, into their car cabin,
where they are left to essentially “stew” their lungs in these toxins. People who don’t own cars are more likely
to be economically distressed, and when living in an urban or suburban environment, are also more likely to
suffer from frequent or daily exposures to vehicular exhaust. Walking in urban areas where there are many cars
with bad emissions increases exposure to these emissions, as the time taken during a single trip is orders of
magnitude greater by foot than by car. In more distressed urban areas, walkers will be exposed to more and
worse emissions. In urban areas, most bus stops are at traffic lights, where groups of vehicles idle and then must
start again, producing the most pollution when reinitiating forward movement. People without cars often must
rely on buses for transportation, and can spend an inordinate amount of time sitting at bus stops as a result.


Individuals living in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed communities are
often those who have lower paying jobs that involve exposure to toxins. Many paints and almost all solvents
have toxins in them, and often, jobs involving painting or the use of solvents are lower-paying. Also, not only
do they do others’ dirty work, e.g., painting other people’s houses — but they also often do their own home
improvement repairs, because it further saves on costs.


Finally, individuals living in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed
communities often do not have the resources to buy healthier food. Many of the cheaper foods we buy are
sprayed with chemicals, and packaged in plastic. We need to eliminate this differential stratum in food pricing,
                                                                 1
            EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                  268
 and simply make organic foods the default. We also need to educate people about the dangers of involving
plastics in food, and reduce or eliminate plastics use where possible in food packaging.

A primary component of your line item, “Making a Visible Difference in Communities,"" needs to
involve educating the general public about how particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons in vehicle exhaust are cancerous; how many of the products we use in everyday
applications, such as solvents, etc., are cancerous; how these and related compounds leak from our
vehicles and onto our lands, and then run into our waters during rains; and how we breathe in these
components daily when living in urban environments and / or working with readily available products
such as paints and solvents. Education ought to also include more in depth information about
pesticides, and how components in plastic can leech into food and health problems — including but
not limited to problems in developing fetuses.

With this preliminary summary of problem and need, I now give you several concrete solutions that I
urge you to take on immediately, with the help of other relevant Departments, and with the goal of
preventing further health disparities negative outcomes for people in environmentally overburdened,
underserved, and economically distressed communities. A side benefit includes the fact that these
improvements will have rippling effects that will positively impact individuals in all communities.


1) Outlaw all fracking outright.
2) Aggressively pursue the creation of fossil-fuel free energy, a/k/a Renewable Energy (RE), lobbying
to use funds from the Department of Defense's discretionary budget for widespread startup and
implementation.
3) Implement standardization of battery packs for electric vehicles, so that battery replacement can
happen on a large scale (and batteries don't need to be sent back to the original owner; although, I
strongly suspect only hydrogen may be the better option).
4) Aggressively pursue the installation of RE highways on all interstates, to implement stations
wherein hydrogen cell fuel and battery swaps are available. Provide strong incentives to gas station
owners and gas companies to invest in the turnover to RE. Add to / replace existing fossil fuel
stations whenever possible. Must have both hydrogen and battery pack swaps available every X
miles on RE highway (unless hydrogen proves the better option -- no lithium -- a limited resource, is
required; can power a range of vehicle engine sizes from hydrogen).
5) Get large cities over a certain metropolitan size, on the fast track of implementation of vehicular RE
over the span of 5-10 years, max.
6) Federally mandate cities over a certain metropolitan size (say, 1 million residents) to begin
planning and building state-of-the-art and comprehensive RE commuter rail, reaching from all
suburban areas, to all major destinations (e.g., universities, airports, courthouses, entertainment
districts).
7) Implement a mandatory fuel conversion plan, wherein vehicles older than the year 2000, and all
two-wheeled vehicles must be hydrogen or electric. Invest heavily in matching funds for this program,
as you will be hitting a lower socio-economic target here, and the goal is to improve people's health
and the health of the environment -- not to make tons of money from already disadvantaged
individuals. Require this by 2020. Quickly pull in existing fossil fuel workforce for training and
implementation of new program. Every five years, raise the year cutoff by five years, until there are no
more fossil fuel powered vehicles (or maybe it would make better business sense, for continuity, if we
raised the cutoff every year by a year or two — while actively creating a work transition conduit for
people in this business to pursue training in related, or if desired, unrelated line of work after
conversion is complete, as conversion program will have a limited life).

 8) Require all states to be at AT LEAST 50% RE for both uses (vehicular and non-vehicular) by
2020.
9) Require conversion of all semi trucks, nationwide, to RE by 2020.
10) Require conversion of all vehicles involved in governmental affairs (city to federal), whether via
public-private partnership (e.g., USPS) or directly, to convert to RE by 2020.
11) Generate and enforce stricter standards for distance of residential living from coal burning plants
— factoring in issues such as (1) pollutants and contaminants generally flow downhill in water, and
(3) coal ash can disperse in any direction based on weather patterns.
12) Require conversion of all landscape-related equipment with engines, to hydrogen or electric by
2020.
13) Seek to put measures in place to limit vehicular number, size, and turnover for the general
population. Making fewer vehicles of smaller size will be less taxing on the workers making vehicles,
exposed to carpet off-gassing, welding solder, solvents, plastic, etc. etc. etc.
14) Make engine emissions STRICT, and make their violation a finable offense. If an officer can do a
breathalyzer test, they can do a tailpipe test. Hire more law enforcement and demand strict
enforcement — BUT MAKE CONVERSION FREE FOR THE POOR, MAKE SURE THERE IS A
WARNING / INFORMATION / REMEDIATION MECHANISM IN PLACE (e.g., if your tail light is out
you can get it fixed, bring evidence of getting it fixed to judge, and you don’t have to pay fine — do
same thing with hydrogen conversion).
15) Get fossil fuel related participants OUT OF The Department of Energy’s H2 design and
implementation measures — unless they have a very clear and detailed plan for cycling down fossil
fuels to zero and ramping up in renewable energy. Otherwise, IT IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
16) REQUIRE electric vehicle manufacturers to actively work toward phasing in aluminum metal-air
batteries, with the goal of completely eliminating the manufacture of new lithium-ion batteries by 2020
(lithium is a much more limited resource than aluminum).
17) Provide welfare assistance for a family with up to two biological children. Cut off welfare
assistance wherein family has more than two biological children. We have the right to procreate, but
increasing population is bad for the environment.
18) Enforce a requirement of the provision of only organic food.
19) Require one certified OSHA expert on site per number of individuals working in industrial settings
to actively work with, observe, and enforce stricter standards (e.g., masks and not just hardhats worn
at construction sites), and provide very detailed and specific and ongoing training on safety hazards
for workers. What may be salient to one worker (e.g., inhalation of toxin could lead to liver damage in
later life), may be different from what is salient to another worker (e.g., inhalation could cause
immediate degradation of sperm quality, increasing probability of birth defects).
20) Ban all styrofoam applications for use by public.
21) Very actively and strongly reduce the use of plastics in food packaging — both unnecessary
packaging, and packaging wherein liquid / oily / acidic food is directly in contact with plastics for a
prolonged period.
22) Require all products possible (e.g., paints, adhesives, etc.) that have variants that are low in or
have no volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to switch to providing only the low- or no-VOC variants.
23) In all applications possible, eliminate spray versions of substances (e.g., sunscreens, paints,
solvents, etc.).
24) Aggressively target janitorial workforce health by carefully considering those things to which
people working in a supportive cleaning capacity are exposed to daily, and consider omitting the more
toxic variants such as powders (e.g., Comet, which is easily and repeatedly inhaled), and toxic
cleaning solutions (e.g., I recently confirmed that Fabuloso has a nasty chemical or two in it) from the
list of allowable cleaning agents. Require affordable, less toxic alternatives, and implement training
and education in this vein.

Subject:                         EJ EPA 2020 Plan Comment


Hello,

My comments are brief, and I speak for myself.

State Application
After reviewing this strategy in the context of EJ at EPA since the early 90”s this Plan is a
testament to the decades of EJ work done, the undeniable and overriding importance of EJ, and a
road map for parts of EJ in the future. It is evident that an unusual amount of thought, focus,
collaboration and expertise went into the 2020 proposed plan. In many ways this particular plan
could be a foundation for state environmental agencies with the political willpower to engage EJ
issues. It is not, however, as useful in the many states which choose not to engage in Environmental
Justice. Many state environmental agencies simply do not engage in our issues, and usually are
obstacles.
       It is for this reason the emphasis on Title VI is important. Although there is no longer a
private right of action via Title VI, there is a course of action from a federal agency to state agency
that could rescind EPA monies from non complying states and local governments. There was a
Title VI FACA subcommittee many years ago at EPA with Lang Marsh as chair that fleshed out the
issues, for a historical and agency perspective.

OCR lack of plan
The EPA 2020 plan notes the lack of an OCR plan. The lack of a Office of Civil Rights plan within
the context of this plan could be an issue, again. OCR was where many EJ people at the EPA
regional level were moved. They didn't do much EJ work. OCR’s work is organizationally
different. Without a clear statement as to OCRs work plan it seem like this relocation of EJ could
happen again. Although EPA EJ personnel are unlikely to comment on this it has been an issue
for them, along with job and career stability at EPA.

Rural populations and methodology
The EJ Screen is a terrific piece of work. We are waiting to see whether it is a nice piece of policy
research that develops concrete EJ sensitive policy recommendations that are implemented, unlike
EISs which are advisory and often categorically excluded as not required. The Portland Superfund
Site is of particular interest. I hope that it is transparent, and is applicable to all populations, not just
urban populations. To the extent it relies on Census data it will fall short because of Privacy Act
limitations on rural census data. Rural areas in my state, including tribal and band lands, are
becoming dumping grounds.

EJ Inclusion: advancing the dialogue

                                                             1
            EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                272
 The plan does a wonderful job of including some EJ voices and issues, but not all. That is to be
expected because many EJ folks are often financially stressed and coping day to day. It is not to be
accepted, although the only answer I have is to pay people for lost work when they participate. It is
obvious that the plan process was long and motivated by inclusion, but research in
my encyclopedias does turn up other types of EJ. Some of the missing EJ voices are from
academics, both nationally and internationally; overburdened communities in rural areas; local
government; and state level advocacy groups outside of state agencies. Some of the loudly silent
voices seem to be the mainstream US environmental organizations, big business and their state and
federal trade associations, and health workers. This may not reflect on the plan, but on their
willingness to collaborate with EJ. Personally as an activist, and chair of the EJTF in Oregon when
we won the EPA collaboration award, I fear a growing lack of collaborative partners for us. I hope
this plan with some of the initiatives will actually increase the pool of collaborative partners for us
outside and inside the agency.

Conclusion
Many environmental policies fall short because of a failure to address issues of institutional racism,
with “sustainability” becoming the latest one. Epigenetic impacts will even further prove the long
reaching human impact of avoiding EJ. While this is a very good plan, it does not engage local
government in a way that obstacles to implementation, such as institutional racism, are addressed.
Almost all environmental problems are solved and mitigated on the site in the community. EJ leads
the way in developing realistic environmental problem solutions because it directly confronts
conflictual values of on the ground implementation of industrial and environmental projects. While
awkward for some, it is a necessary growing pain for a mature and inclusive environmental policy.
That is why the 2020 Plan is at the cutting edge of environmental policy right now in the US.

Respectfully Submitted

Robert W. Collin

Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice
USEPA, Office of Environmental Justice (2201-A)

RE: To EJ 2020 Open Public Comment Period


Dear Charles Lee,
The EPA is distinguished among many government agencies by positioning their works within the
priorities and context of communities affected by the unjust geographies of environmental pollution.
If there is something we hear from EJ communities in San Juan is that the EPA is always there when
you need them. The history of EPA in Puerto Rico is the victory of many communities struggling for
social and environmental justice. In our barrios and communities as many other places, the antidote
for the long term mitigation of environmental injustice is the participatory planning for a sustainable
community development. This type of planning requires deep levels of commitment, organization
and capacity building, both facilitated by EPA to many local residents of the EJ communities in Puerto
Rico. However, we are curious and interested in knowing the planning processes and methodology
for creating the EJ 2020 Action Agenda framework.
Following the community based and participatory tradition of the San Juan Bay Estuary Program, on
November of 2013 we started working closely with local communities of the San Juan Bay Estuary on
a multidisciplinary and participatory project that has the goal of identifying point and non-point
sources pollution in the watersheds of the San Juan Bay Estuary. Our job requires a high level of
commitment and empathy with the local communities affected by social and environmental injustices.
On the other hand the success of our work depends on the trust and emotional bonds established
with the communities affected by the impacts of injustice.
We were invited by our project manager to participate in the last conference for the EJ 2020 Action
Agenda Framework feedback (region 2) held on June 9, 2015. We are deeply grateful for the invitation
to participate in this important matter. However, is our opinion that this passive level of participation
fails to recognize the diverse contributions, inputs, claims, preferences, knowledge and experiences
that local residents of EJ communities have towards the agenda. It would be contradictory to the




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                              274
 proposed goals of EJ 2020 to create an EJ plan without propitiating the participation of the SJBE EJ
communities and many other EJ communities affected by the impacts of unjust geographies.
The EPA knows that reducing inequalities and providing access to the planning and decision making
are requirements for achieving the long term sustainability of justice. The participation of local EJ
communities in the processes of planning the agenda must be a priority since the proposed draft of
the agenda states: “Under Plan EJ 2014, EPA laid a foundation for integrating environmental justice in all its
programs,” hence, suggesting that the EPA is prepared for a robust dialogue with local EJ communities,
as is expected for the creation of the EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. For this dialogue to occur
we proposed stakeholders to transfer the scale of planning the agenda to a local community scale, to
capacitate and propitiate the discussion of local solutions and strategies to attend the development of
environmental injustices.
In our short experience working with EJ communities, community leaders are constantly reminding
the historical social exclusion processes leading up to the development of environmental injustices.
The history of social exclusion is printed in the landscape and memory of local EJ communities,
whereas remembrance of the causes of injustice stimulates the claims and development of justice. We
are convinced that to genuinely include Puerto Rico’s EJ communities’ feedback, the plan should be
contextualized and presented at a local scale and comments should be requested and discussed at this
scale.
As an informal, limited and voluntary exercise to provoke the discussion about the draft goals of the
Action Agenda Framework, we asked community leaders about their environmental situation in
relation to EJ. The following selected answers to questions regarding EJ and the environmental
situation of the community portray some of the common knowledge and perception in regards to EJ.
Interviews were given informally by some leaders of the local communities participating in the project.




-¿What is environmental justice?-

    •    I am not sure
    •    Justice for the environment
    •    ¿To not have environmental problems in my community?
        To avoid the placement of a polluting facility close to my home or community


-¿What is an environmental problem?-

    •    When something affects the environment
    •    When the air’s smell stings
    •    When we have dead fish in the river
    •    When we have trash in the lagoon


-¿What environmental problems does your community have?-

    •    We don’t have garbage dumpsters
    •    We have a waste water treatment plant very close to our homes

      •    We don’t have waste water connection and we have to dump our water straight to the river
     •    When it rains everything gets flooded
     •    Waste water running in the street
     •    Trash in the river
     •    Grey water in the river
     •    Heavy metals in our soils
     •    Our lagoon is filled with everyone’s trash
     •    We can’t use the basketball court because it’s filled with waste water


-¿How do you see your participation in solving these problems?-

     •    Working hand to hand with the government to solve the problems
     •    Actively
     •    Community development
     •    Consulting the community when making a decision that affects the community




Comments to environmental injustice constantly leads to identify social exclusion as part of the
causes of injustice:

-¿What would you identify as the cause of environmental injustices in the community?-


""This happens in a daily basis, the government does not come, we are the ones that have to do the cleanup” Peter, Playita
resident

""I do not understand why they bull dozer comes to cut my trees to create an easement, if these trees do more for us holding the
ground when the river floods” Don Rafa, Sierra Maestra resident

""I would not be surprised if one of these days the government pulls me out of here, to build a hotel"" Don Juan, Plebiscito I,
resident

""The smell is unbearable, I don’t go out anymore or open my windows. I've been in many government agencies and nobody helps
me because I am from the Venezuela community"" Doña Ines, Venezuela resident

""There's something you have to understand, the history of poor communities is the history of the garbage, back then, it was
through garbage the only way that many of us could survive"" South Hill Brother resident

""... A visit? ..., Kid, we are tired of walking the community every time someone comes. The community have walked many times
and no one does anything"" Maria, Villa Kennedy, resident

 Our objective with this letter is to provide feedback towards the processes for planning the EJ 2020
Agenda Action Framework, not to provide feedback on the draft. The main comment of our
feedback is to provide equal, transparent and participatory platforms for encouraging and including
the voice of EJ communities in the EJ 2020 Agenda. This effort will guarantee an equal, just and
sustainable long term effect of EPA actions for tackling environmental injustices.

We are deeply grateful for your consideration to our comments. If you have any question,
suggestion and/or need more information please contact us to facilitadorestuario@gmail.com and

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                                                              280
         Thank you for accepting these comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s
(“EPA”) Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework (June 15, 2015) (“EJ 2020 Framework”). The
Sierra Club is the oldest and largest grassroots environmental group, with over 1.2 million
members and supporters. The Sierra Club has joined with other environmental groups in a
detailed set of comments to EPA’s EJ 2020 Framework focused on demonstrating progress on
outcomes that matter to minority and low income communities and creating specific initiatives
that will assist the agency in achieving this progress. These comments discuss in more detail
how to integrate environmental justice (“EJ”) in rule making and rule implementation, with an
emphasis on practical suggestions to effectively apply the EPA’s recently finalized “Guidance on
Considering Environmental Justice During the Development of Regulatory Actions” (“Final
Guidance”), focused primarily on air pollution rules.

         The Sierra Club would also like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank EPA staff
for its continued commitment to comply with Executive Order (“EO”) 12898, Federal Actions to
Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, which
requires every federal agency to make environmental justice a part of its mission. However, as
these comments note, there is still much left to do for environmental justice to truly take root
in every section of the agency. As numerous studies have documented and EPA has also
acknowledged, minority, low income, and indigenous communities often live in close proximity
to large sources of air and water pollution, experience adverse or even disproportionate health
impacts resulting from numerous environmental hazards, and have less opportunities to
participate meaningfully in decisions that affect their health and environment. Minority and
low income communities are also more likely to reside in areas vulnerable to climate change
impacts such as sea-level rise and to spend higher proportions of their income as a result of
rising food prices or increased water scarcity.

         Consistent with its obligations under EO 12898, EPA must integrate environmental
justice in all its regulatory actions, assessing not only whether the agency’s regulations would
have the potential of creating adverse or disproportionate impacts on minority and low-income
populations, but also whether those communities in particular can receive the benefits
expected from the implementation of those rules. These comments offer practical suggestions
on how to effectively put into practice EPA’s Final Guidance to implement EO 12898, in order to
ensure that EPA appropriately addresses environmental justice both in the development and
implementation of the agency’s regulatory actions. Toward this end, we also provide input on
EPA’s environmental justice screening tools, with an emphasis on EJSCREEN, which EPA recently
released, and EJView, which the agency plans to discontinue this fall.

    I.       Incorporating environmental justice in rule making

    A. EPA must prepare an environmental justice analysis of every federal rule under EO
       12898 and the agency’s policies that implement it

       Executive Order (“EO”) 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, requires each federal agency to make

                                                1

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         281
 environmental justice part of its mission “by identifying and addressing, as appropriate,
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs,
policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United
States.”1 EO 12898 requires all federal agencies to collect, maintain, and analyze information
that assesses and compares environmental and human health risks to populations identified by
race, national origin or income, and to use that information in determining whether their
actions have “disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on
minority populations and low-income populations.”2

        Incorporating environmental justice into the rule making process is a critical part of
implementing EO 12898. Sierra Club commends EPA for its continued commitment to make
this one of the agency’s focus areas, now under its Plan EJ 2020. The recently-finalized Final
Guidance will be an important tool to assist EPA’s rule writers and decision makers in
incorporating EJ in its “Action Development Process” (“ADP”) for developing environmental
regulations.3 As EPA notes, rule making will be more effective if, following the Final Guidance,
EJ is considered not only in the development of the rules themselves, but also in other “up-
front” actions that support the development of those regulations, such as risk assessments and
analytical tools.4

        Sierra Club shares EPA’s view that the agency’s rules need not entail “disproportionate”
impacts in order to trigger a requirement to protect the health and environment of minority,
low income, and indigenous communities (“EJ communities”). As the Final Guidance notes, the
Clean Air Act “provide[s] a broader basis for protecting human health and the environment.”5
Consistent with its authority under the Act, EPA may address any adverse impacts from the
implementation of a rule on EJ communities without having to show that those impacts are
disproportionate. If EPA is required to make such a determination in particular contexts,
however, EPA’s Final Guidance provides a good recommendation that agency staff must
implement in every rule they craft—to consider “the severity and nature of health
consequences; the magnitude of the estimated differences in impacts between population
groups; mean or median exposures or risks to relevant population groups; distributions of
exposures or risk to relevant population groups; characterization of the uncertainty; and a
discussion of factors that may make population groups more vulnerable.”6

       EPA must promote the effective use and robust implementation of the Final Guidance,
as proposed in its EJ 2020 Framework.7 Consistent with EPA’s obligations under EO 12898, EPA

 must prepare an EJ analysis in every rule it issues. EPA and other federal agencies have for
many years conducted cost-benefit (“CBA”) analyses for each and every “significant” action
they issue, in accordance with EO 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. 8 Just like CBA has
become a critical component of agencies’ decision making, we believe that EJ analyses must
become more rigorous in order to really become an integral part of the regulatory process.
This would also help offset some of the gaps in traditional CBA analyses, which do not focus
centrally on distributional issues.9 Effective integration of EJ concerns into EPA’s regulatory
analysis would provide both substantive and practical benefits. It would also fully comport with
EPA’s legal mandates under EO 12866 and EO 12898. Perhaps most importantly, integrated
CBA and EJ analyses would help ensure that EJ considerations are not overlooked at key
moments in the decision-making process and that EJ communities are treated like equal
stakeholders, whose costs and benefits are, as a matter of fact, part of the CBA calculus.

        Sierra Club fully supports the Final Guidance’s expansion of the concept of “fair
treatment” to include the distribution of benefits of the agency’s regulations across all
populations, in particular EJ communities. In light of this expanded concept, agency staff
should not only evaluate potential adverse impacts to these communities, but also “the
distribution of the positive environmental and health consequences resulting from their
regulatory actions.”10 Thus, as part of its EJ analyses, agency staff must assess not only whether
the agency’s regulations would have the potential of creating adverse impacts on minority, low-
income, and indigenous populations, but also whether those communities specifically can
receive the expected benefits of those rules. Robust implementation of the Guidance means

  The draft Technical Guidance for Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis (“Draft
Technical Guidance”), which EPA must finalize this year, observes that “analyses of potential EJ concerns
are often conducted separately from an assessment of benefits and costs (i.e., benefit-cost analysis
evaluates efficiency, while analyses of potential EJ concerns evaluate whether impacts are distributed
differently).” It also notes that consideration of EJ concerns is distinct from “other parts of the
regulatory analysis” such as CBA; that “the focus of E.O. 12898 is on human health or environmental
effects, which is generally at least one step prior to monetization of benefits and precludes certain other
benefit categories covered in the EPA’s Economic Guidelines;” and that decision-makers are to consider
distributional impacts analyses “along with” efficiency analyses. U.S. EPA, Draft Technical Guidance for
Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis, Post-Internal Agency Review Draft, May 1, 2013,
at 4, n. 14., 5, n. 17. See also Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), “Circular A-4” (September 17,
2003), available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/ (implying that the two
analyses should be separate). However, the Draft Technical Guidance fails to note that EPA’s own
description of its Economic Guidelines states that they “provide guidance on analyzing the benefits,
costs, and economic impacts of regulations and policies, including assessing the distribution of costs and
benefits among various segments of the population.” U.S. EPA, Guidelines for Preparing Economic
Analyses, available at http://yosemite.epa.gov/EE%5Cepa%5Ceed.nsf/webpages/Guidelines.html. EPA
needs to revise its Draft Technical Guidance to address this possible inconsistency. In particular, EPA
should provide its staff with clear guidance on exactly at what point in the regulatory process will EPA
ensure that EJ concerns are considered “along with” efficiency, and what will be the relative priority of
the two if/when they conflict.

 that, going forward, EPA’s analyses of the environmental justice implications of its rules should
be done differently if EPA really is to make environmental justice part of its mission. The
following comments offer practical suggestions on how to implement the Guidance and ensure
that the rules EPA issues address EJ appropriately.

        Finally, Sierra Club supports EPA’s direction to rule writers to consider environmental
justice not only in the development of the agency’s regulatory actions, but also in the
implementation of those actions.11 As these comments detail, EPA must provide guidance and
work closely with states in developing implementation plans to comply with applicable EPA
standards and in developing the operating permit program to comply with these requirements
at the state level in a manner that addresses environmental justice effectively.

     B. EPA must establish more stringent standards for the regulation of pollutants that
        affect minority and low income communities

        In order to effectively implement the Final Guidance in the rule making context, EPA
must establish more stringent and more protective standards for the regulation of pollutants
that affect the health of environmental justice communities. For example, in its proposed
Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ground-Level Ozone (“ozone
NAAQS”), EPA concluded that “the human health or environmental risk addressed by this action
will not have potential disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental
effects on minority, low-income or indigenous populations because it does not affect the level
of protection provided to human health or the environment,” and that, if finalized, the revised
ozone NAAQS will actually increase public health protections.12 Contrary to this statement, the
level of the standard established by EPA will affect the level of protection to human health and
the environment, including for minority, low income, and indigenous communities. The more
stringent the final standard is, the more benefits EJ communities will receive from the
implementation of the ozone rule.

         EPA’s proposed Regulatory Impact Analysis (“ozone RIA”) to the proposed ozone NAAQS
provides a limited analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of populations living in
counties with monitors with current design values (2011-2013) that exceed the proposed
standards (65 to 70 ppb). As the agency itself indicates, the analysis does not identify in detail
the demographic characteristics of the most affected communities nor does it quantify the level
of risk those communities currently face. The RIA does not provide state-level or county-level
information either, and it does not assess in detail the health burdens that EJ communities face.
EPA has thus concluded that the analysis “cannot be used to draw any conclusions regarding
potential disparities in exposure or risk across populations of interest from an EJ perspective.”13

         On the other hand, based on this limited analysis EPA has quickly concluded that, to the
extent that an EJ community is disproportionately impacted by ozone levels because it resides
in an area of interest (i.e., an area which ozone levels exceed the proposed standard), those
communities stand “to see increased environmental and health benefits from the emission
reductions called for by this proposed rule,” and that the proposed standard “will tend to
benefit” geographic areas with a larger proportion of minority (particularly Hispanic and
African-American) and low-income residents than the national average.14 EPA has the
opportunity to address and ameliorate existing adverse impacts on EJ communities in revising
the ozone NAAQS standard by setting a stringent level and form for the new standard, which
will contribute to decrease the disproportionate ozone-related health burdens that EJ
communities (in particular minorities) bear throughout the country, both in non-attainment
and attainment areas, as detailed below.

     1. Minority and low income communities are disproportionately exposed to higher levels
        and health impacts of ozone air pollution

        Ozone is a public health threat. Ozone exposure can cause numerous health problems,
including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion.15 Breathing ozone inflames
and damages the airways, reduces lung function, and continues to damage the lungs even after
symptoms have disappeared.16 Ozone also makes the lungs more susceptible to infection and
repeated exposures may permanently scar lung tissue and cause premature death from heart
or lung disease. Ozone is particularly dangerous for those who already suffer from respiratory
illnesses because it can trigger and exacerbate conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and
chronic bronchitis.17 Sensitive populations such as children and the elderly are especially
susceptible to the negative health effects of ozone.18 These effects lead to increased school
absences, work absences, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and reliance on
medication.19

       Minority and low income communities are disproportionately exposed to higher levels
of ozone air pollution, to more types of elevated air pollution and to more chronic air pollution.
African-Americans, in particular, are at higher risk of early death from ozone pollution than the

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                285
 general population. Bell et al. (2008)20 examined 98 urban communities in the U.S. and
reported that the risk between ozone and mortality was greatest in areas with high
unemployment, a higher percentage of African-Americans, higher public transportation use,
and a lower availability of air conditioning.

        There are far higher proportions of minority populations than white populations living in
ozone non-attainment areas. The Sierra Club has cross-referenced census data, EPA’s
nonattainment designations for the 2008 ozone standard, and levels of ozone (2011-2013
design values for the 2008 ozone standard) in several states,21 finding that this is a clear and
persistent trend. (See Appendix A.) Sierra Club has provided this information as part of its joint
comments22 to EPA’s proposed ozone standard, and reiterates it here as a means to provide
practical suggestions to EPA on how to analyze EJ issues and implement its Final Guidance in
the context of the ozone rulemaking. Sierra Club hopes that this information also contributes
to further EPA’s obligation to collect and analyze information on environmental and human
health risks borne by populations identified by race, national origin, or income, as mandated
under Section 3-302(a) of EO 12898.

         Sierra Club’s analysis found that, in the south of the country, Alabama, Arkansas, North
Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas all have higher relative concentrations of
blacks—sometimes far higher—living in areas that fail to meet the 2008 ozone standards than
concentrations of whites when compared to average state wide racial demographics. The same
holds true for central and mid-west states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Kansas,
and Oklahoma are particularly notable in the over representation of blacks living in areas that
fail to meet minimum air quality standards for ozone. Nevada also follows this trend. This trend
can also be seen in eastern and mid-Atlantic states, where Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have
higher relative exposures among blacks than whites, though in other states, such as New York
and Virginia, minorities that are at greater relative exposure than whites are Hispanics and
Asians.

       Indeed, as Appendix B demonstrates,23 for many states there is a striking correlation
between increasing concentrations of smog, increasing concentrations of people of color and
decreasing concentrations of whites in areas that fail to meet minimum air quality standards.

 Stated another way, as air quality progressively worsens, representation of people of color
increases while representation of whites in the population decreases.

        It is also undisputed that ozone is a trigger for asthma attacks. Minority and low income
communities suffer a disproportionately higher asthma burden in the United States –
particularly African-Americans, Hispanics (especially Puerto Ricans), and Native Americans.

         In absolute number terms, African-Americans are most heavily burdened by asthma in
the U.S. Nationally, the current asthma prevalence rate for non-Hispanic blacks is 11.9%,
compared to 8.1% for non-Hispanic whites and 7.0% for Hispanics.24 While the prevalence rate
reflects a relatively significant impact, it actually understates asthma’s true burden on the
African-American community. Other key statistical measures of asthma’s impact – including
hospitalization rates, emergency department visit rates, and mortality rates – show a much
starker contrast amongst races, with disproportionate impacts of approximately 200-400%
when comparing non-Hispanic blacks to non-Hispanic whites. Figure 1, which includes statistics
from several states that have recent data in at least three of the four major categories,
illustrates this pattern:

 * Per 100,000 persons
**Indiana data provides raw mortality numbers but not mortality rates. In 2011, 73 Indiana residents died from
asthma, 54 of whom were white and 18 of whom were black. African-Americans thus comprised approximately
24% of asthma deaths despite accounting for only 9% of Indiana’s total population.

        As the data summarized above shows, asthma’s disproportionate impact is greater for
the most serious, life-threatening asthma-related complications. Not only are African
Americans more likely to have asthma, but even among asthma sufferers, they are more likely
to have the worst asthma-related complications, as not all individuals who have asthma suffer
from it equally. In other words, a higher percentage of African-Americans have asthma, but an
even higher percentage suffers from its most serious symptoms and outcomes.

        Minority groups other than African-Americans are also disproportionately affected by
asthma. Nationally, Hispanics (especially Puerto Ricans) and American Indians/Native Alaskans
have a much higher current asthma prevalence rate than even African-Americans, at 16.7% and
14.3% respectively.30 In Hawaii, the prevalence rate for Native Hawaiians is 14.9%, compared to
only 9.0% for whites living in Hawaii.31 Asthma’s heavy burden on these groups is also evident
from other statistical measures. Nationally, the mortality rate for Puerto Ricans is four times
higher than the mortality rate for whites.32 Similar trends exist at the state level for Native
Americans. In Oregon and Wisconsin, for example, the American Indian hospitalization rate is
double the rate for non-Hispanic whites.33 And while asthma prevalence among the total
Hispanic population is actually lower than the national average, Hispanics also have higher
hospitalization and mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites, and thus also suffer
disproportionately.34 Hispanics are 30% more likely to visit the hospital for asthma, as
compared to non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanic children are 40% more likely to die from
asthma.

       Epidemiological studies also suggest that socioeconomic status (“SES”) is associated
with higher risks of ozone-related health outcomes.35 EPA concludes that “most studies of

 individuals have reported that individuals with low SES and those living in neighborhoods with
low SES are more at risk for O3-related health effects, resulting in increased risk of respiratory
hospital admissions and ED visits.”36 For example, a New York City study showed that children
with lower socioeconomic status had greater risk of ozone-induced hospital admissions for
asthma.37 Accordingly, the ISA noted that “evidence is suggestive of SES as a factor affecting risk
of O3-related health outcomes.”38

       Even in ozone attainment areas, environmental justice communities are adversely
affected by high ozone pollution levels due to the weak form of the current (2008) ozone
NAAQS. The form, known as the “design value,” is the three-year average of the fourth highest
8-hour average ozone concentration. This form of the standard completely ignores the top
three ozone concentrations each year, and thus authorizes extremely high levels of ozone
without triggering any requirement to clean the air.

        There are many areas largely in the eastern region that have recently attained the 2008
ozone NAAQS of 75 ppb based on 2012-2014 design values. However, it is important to note
that this shift is largely based on aberrant weather, as ozone and temperature are inextricably
linked, rather than a result of permanent and enforceable emission reductions. Despite now
being in attainment, many of these areas have regular and extreme exceedances, up to 111
ppb, that threaten public health but are entirely permissible due to the weak form of the ozone
NAAQS.

        For example, the Baltimore community regularly suffers from ozone exceedances up to
109 ppb, as the following graph shows. 39 Baltimore City has the highest percentage of people
living below the poverty line in the entire state40 and is predominantly black. Moreover, blacks
are over 30% over-represented and whites are 25% under-represented compared to the state
average.41 Baltimore City also consistently has the highest asthma prevalence, rates of
emergency department visits, hospitalization and death caused by asthma in all of Maryland,
which already has disproportionately high asthma rates compared to the rest of the nation.42

 Blacks Marylanders bear a significant asthma burden statewide as they are over 3 times as
likely to visit the hospital for asthma, over 4 times as likely to visit the emergency department
for asthma, and nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white Marylanders.43

        Yet EPA issued a “Clean Data Determination” for the Baltimore area, thus suspending
any obligations to improve local air quality, despite the endemic EJ and asthma issues in the
area. In order to effectively implement its Final Guidance, EPA should be cognizant of these EJ
concerns in the rulemaking process when setting the level and form of the ozone NAAQS, as
problematic areas such as Baltimore City can be in attainment despite their high ozone levels
which further exacerbate adverse health impacts to those communities.

        Similarly, Charlotte, North Carolina, achieved attainment based on its 2012-2014 design
value largely due to aberrant weather. EPA promptly proposed a “Clean Data Determination”
and “Redesignation to Attainment” for the area, despite the regular and severe ozone
exceedances (up to 111 ppb) as displayed in the graph below,44 and disproportionate asthma
burdens on people of color and low-income communities. For example, African American adults
and children are significantly more (up to twice as) likely to have lifetime and current asthma
compared to whites; three times as likely to be hospitalized for asthma; and twice as likely to
die from asthma compared to whites.45 Additionally, low income households (less than
$25,000) are about twice as likely to have lifetime and current asthma compared to the highest

asthma burdens and will soon have no obligation to improve its air quality due to the weak
form on the NAAQS.

        The Philadelphia area also recently came into attainment, but still endures frequent
exceedances, well above the current standard of 75 ppb and at levels deemed unsafe by EPA, as
the following graph shows.47 Once again, these egregious exceedances are entirely permissible
due to the weak form of the NAAQS. The Philadelphia area has some of the highest asthma
rates in the entire state. The Southeast region of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia, has
the highest asthma hospitalization rate, emergency room visit rate, and lifetime asthma
prevalence amongst school students in the entire state. And as displayed in the graph below,
blacks are significantly overrepresented and whites are underrepresented in Philadelphia.48
Blacks bear a disproportionate asthma burden, as black children are nearly twice as likely to
have lifetime asthma as white children in Pennsylvania. Moreover, Blacks are also over five
times as likely to be hospitalized for asthma as whites, and Hispanics are three times as likely.
And finally, Blacks are over three times as likely to die from asthma as whites.

        It is evident that throughout the country, in both currently attaining and non-attaining
areas, minority and low-income communities are disproportionately exposed to ozone and bear
an undue asthma burden. EPA must address these EJ concerns when setting the level and form
of the new ozone NAAQS.

    C. It is practicable to require states to conduct an environmental justice analysis as part
       of implementation plan submission and approval

        Effective implementation of EPA’s Final Guidance in the rule making context also means
that, in the context of rules where EPA cannot initially perform an environmental justice
analysis due to lack of information on the content of state implementation plans, the agency
should require states to conduct such an analysis as part of plan submission and approval. For
                                                     12

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                       292
 example, in the proposed Clean Power Plan, EPA has not performed the analysis required by EO
12898.49 The agency states that, because it “cannot exactly predict how emissions from specific
EGUs would change as an outcome of the proposed rule due to the state-led implementation …
it is not practicable to determine whether there would be disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects on minority, low income, or indigenous populations
from this proposed rule.” In addition, the proposed rule highlights the co-benefits of the Clean
Power Plan in terms of emissions reductions from criteria and hazardous air pollutants, but
does not look at how those benefits could be distributed to minority and low-income
communities because there is no analysis of communities overburdened by criteria air
pollutants and their resulting health impacts.50

        In the proposed Clean Power Plan, EPA is essentially leaving the decision on how to
avoid the creation of environmental justice impacts to the states. The proposed rule provides
that a state can take steps to avoid increased utilization of particular fossil fuel-fired power
plants, and thus avoid increased emissions of regulated pollutants with localized environmental
effects. To the extent that states take this course of action, “there would be no new
environmental justice concerns in the areas near such EGUs.”51 EPA also contemplates that any
environmental justice impacts that result from the implementation of the rule will be dealt with
after the fact, because existing tracking systems will inform EPA and the states of which power
plants have increased their utilization significantly, to enable them to prioritize efforts in
assessing changes in air quality in the vicinity of such plants.52

         The Clean Power Plan differs from other environmental rules because, as proposed, it
provides states with great flexibility to comply with the required state targets through the
combination of emission reduction measures that makes the most sense depending on their
particular circumstances. This is why EPA cannot at this point predict with certainty which fossil
fuel-fired plants will increase or decrease their utilization as a result of the implementation of
this rule. While EO 12898 is addressed directly to the activities and policies of federal agencies,
in order to implement its Final Guidance effectively EPA could determine, in the context of rules
that provide flexible avenues for compliance (such as, for example, the Clean Power Plan and
rules issued under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, which require the development of state
implementation plans), that it is practicable to require states to conduct an environmental
justice analysis as part of the development of their implementation plans and to effectively
address EJ concerns in order to receive plan approval. This will ensure that EJ impacts are
avoided and benefits to EJ communities are encouraged as a matter of compliance plan design.

 To this end, EPA needs to provide guidance to states on how to prepare this analysis and
effectively address environmental justice in their plans.

        EPA is also authorized to require owners or operators of affected stationary sources to
provide necessary information to assist in the development of state plans pursuant to Section
114 of the Clean Air Act.53 The information collected from states and owners and operators of
affected sources will enable the agency to prepare a full-fledged environmental justice analysis
as required under EO 12898, which EPA should complete before approval of state plans. Once
the agency has collected and assessed state-specific environmental justice analyses, this
information will enable it to assess the environmental justice implications of its rules (in terms
both of mitigation of adverse impacts and distribution of benefits) at the national level.

     D. EPA must provide guidance to staff and states on how to conduct an environmental
        justice analysis and address minority and low-income communities’ concerns

        EPA must provide guidance to its own staff (both in Headquarters and in the EPA
Regions) and to states on how to prepare an environmental justice analysis and address
adverse impacts and distribution of benefits to minority and low-income communities in the
agency’s rules and their implementation plans. EPA has done robust environmental justice
analyses of its rules in the past that can help towards this guidance. In particular, the
environmental justice analysis to the Definition of Solid Waste (“DSW”) rule,54 together with
EPA’s Final Guidance, provide agency staff and states with a robust sample methodology that
they can use (and then adjust as appropriate) to develop expanded EJ analyses. In the EJ
analysis on the DSW rule, EPA mapped the facilities that it thought may take advantage of the
rule against the demographics of the surrounding communities, finding that certain population
groups would experience an increased risk of adverse impacts. EPA then incorporated means
to mitigate these adverse impacts, for example, by closely monitoring the facilities that notify
under the rule.55

       The Draft DSW Rule analysis used a 6-step approach to identify affected areas and
formulate targeted requirements to improve both oversight and accountability for hazardous
materials recycling regulated under the rule:56

       2. Identification of potentially affected communities
      3. Demographics of potentially affected communities
      4. Identification of other factors that affect vulnerability in potentially affected
         communities
      5. Assessment of disproportional impact
      6. Identification of potential preventive and mitigation strategies

        In providing guidance to agency staff and states on how to perform an environmental
justice analysis of an environmental rule, we suggest EPA to review the above methodology and
perform those steps that it can readily execute using publicly available information on pollution
from the regulated sources contained in the agency’s various databases, demographic
information available in the U.S. Census, and information on cumulative impacts, as
documented in extensive research under various EPA programs and environmental justice
screening tools. Sierra Club believes that, under any rule, EPA can characterize the potential
hazards from the application of the relevant rule in detail.

       EPA can also identify potentially affected communities (in many cases located in close
proximity to the sources of pollution regulated under the relevant rules) and their demographic
make-up. In the context of the Clean Power Plan, for example, EPA can assess and explain the
co-pollutant implications of the increased utilization of coal-fired and gas-fired plants that are
located in areas where minority and low income communities reside. Utilizing its unit-level
data, EPA can identify plants with large co-pollutant emission levels and “map” these facilities
against the demographics of the surrounding communities.

        EPA can also assess other factors that increase the vulnerability of those communities
(for example, other sources of pollution), based on information available in its own
environmental justice screening tools such as EJSCREEN and EJView, as well as web-based tools
such as Google Earth. EPA may also require states to provide detailed information on their
minority, low income, and indigenous communities and the different kinds of localized pollution
hazards and health impacts they face, some of which is not available in national databases, as
further discussed below.

       In short, Sierra Club believes that the EJ analysis conducted by EPA under its DSW rule
provides a sound methodology to identify potential hazards to environmental justice
communities from the implementation of a rule. It also provides good examples of practical
solutions that EPA took to address EJ concerns in the 2014 DSW final rule; for example, a
requirement that generators send their hazardous secondary materials to a RCRA-permitted
reclaimer or to a verified hazardous secondary materials reclaimer who has obtained a solid
waste variance; detailed requirements for the containers of hazardous secondary materials;
emergency preparedness and response requirements to address the risk of fires, explosions,
and other accidents; and additional recordkeeping requirements for certain persons subject to
“speculative accumulation” requirements.57

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                        295
         On the other hand, the concept of distributing benefits from its rules specifically to
these communities, as provided in EPA’s Final Guidance, needs to be further developed and
implemented. The steps in the methodology above are critical to identify those communities
whose health and environment are and have for years been overburdened by different sources
of pollution, both from the sources regulated under the rules and from other sources.
Strengthening environmental regulations will, as a general rule, provide benefits at the national
level to all populations affected by those rules. But if EPA really is to make environmental
justice part of its mission, the agency also needs to ensure that its agency staff or the states,
where applicable, devise targeted efforts to ensure that those communities receive the benefits
expected from those regulations.

         For example, as discussed above in the context of EPA’s proposed ozone standard,
minority communities are heavily overburdened by ozone pollution in both attainment and
non-attainment areas and, as a consequence, they are greatly affected by asthma, in a much
higher proportion than whites are. In order to truly address benefits to these communities
from the implementation of the ozone rule, the standard needs to be strengthened, both in
level and form. In the Clean Power Plan, EPA has quantified the co-benefits of the proposed
rule in terms of emissions reductions from criteria and hazardous air pollutants, but has also
acknowledged that its benefit-per-ton estimates “may not reflect the local variability in
population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local
factors for any specific location.58 EPA and the states must identify minority and low income
communities potentially affected by the increased utilization of fossil fuel-fired power plants
and ensure that those plants must actually reduce their utilization and thus their emissions.
These communities must also benefit from the expansion of renewable energy and demand-
side energy efficiency, which the Clean Power Plan authorizes as compliance measures.

         In addition, EPA must provide guidance to states on how to integrate environmental
justice in the context of state implementation plan revisions to ensure that states continue to
address adverse impacts and benefits for environmental justice communities as part of this
process. The underlying environmental justice analysis provided as part of initial plan approval
may need to be updated to address potential adverse impacts or opportunities for distribution
of benefits from the proposed plan revisions. EPA should provide guidance on the type and
level of analysis that states should be required to submit as part of their applications for
approval of plan revisions.

        Finally, Sierra Club commends EPA for providing sample language for the EO 12898
section of its rules to agency staff, as the Final Guidance provides.59 In addition, we specifically
recommend EPA to create a central repository for environmental justice analyses, and for rule
writers to prepare memoranda summarizing the key aspects of the relevant rules at issue and
the specific methodologies used in the environmental justice analyses of those rules. If agency

 staff and states have a robust information resource that they can rely on to conduct and
improve their analyses in future rules, the practice of preparing expanded environmental
justice analyses will take root inside the agency and help fulfil the goals of EPA’s EJ 2020
Framework.

     E. Promoting greenhouse gas reduction co-benefits must be a critical component of the
        EJ 2020 Framework

        The EJ 2020 Framework provides that promoting climate adaptation and resilience and
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction co-benefits will be a “related effort” under the Framework.60
Sierra Club fully supports EPA’s proposal to incorporate the concept of co-benefits from GHG
emissions reductions into its Plan EJ 2020, but believes that it cannot be simply a “related
effort.” Instead, EPA should incorporate it as one of the key components of effective
integration of environmental justice in the rule making context. Standards to reduce GHG
emissions from stationary sources such as the Clean Power Plan, which regulates CO₂ emissions
from existing power plants, can result in decreased emissions of both criteria and hazardous air
pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (“SO₂”), nitrogen oxides (“NOₓ”), particulate matter (“PM”),
and mercury (“Hg”). SO₂ causes the formation of fine particle pollution (“PM₂.₅”) and NOₓ is an
ozone (“O3”) precursor. As discussed elsewhere in these comments, these pollutants
contribute to an increased risk of premature death, heart attacks, an increased incidence and
severity of asthma, and other health effects.61

        The Clean Power Plan provides EPA with the opportunity to promote GHG reduction co-
benefits in a manner that effectively addresses environmental justice. EPA has estimated that
the Clean Power Plan will substantially reduce emissions of CO₂, SO₂, NOₓ, and directly emitted
PM₂.₅, which could result in lower ambient concentrations of PM₂.₅ and ozone.62 The agency
has calculated that, in 2020, implementation of the CPP using an individual state compliance
approach would yield climate benefits63 of approximately $18 billion and air pollution co-
benefits ranging between $17 to $40 billion, with net benefits (i.e., less compliance costs) of
$27 to $50 billion.64 In 2030, the climate benefits of this approach are estimated at $31 billion,
and the air pollution health co-benefits are estimated to range between $27 and $62 billion,
with net benefits of $49 to $84 billion.65

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                               297
         Fully taking into account the co-benefits of EPA’s rules aimed at regulating GHG
emissions from air pollution sources is consistent with EO 12866, which requires federal
agencies, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, to select “those approaches
that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and
safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity).”66 OMB’s Circular A-4 further
provides that CBA analyses should include, among other things, “any important ancillary
benefits,” which are the favorable impacts of the alternative under consideration that are
unrelated or secondary to the purpose of the regulatory action.67 EO 12898 and EPA’s policies
provide guidance on how to ensure that those co-benefits are distributed to the populations
that most need it.

       It is clear that policies intended to address climate change by reducing CO₂ emissions
can result in substantial public health benefits through co-pollutant reductions. But EPA must
address the environmental justice part of the equation, by performing (or requiring states to
perform) a robust environmental justice analysis that identifies low income and minority
communities overburdened by the impacts of air pollution (including cumulative impacts) to
ensure that those communities in particular receive the co-pollutant benefits from the rule, for
example, by ensuring that state plans do not allow increased utilization of fossil fuel-fired
power plants that affect these communities and that they provide for expanded renewable
energy and energy efficiency to directly benefit those communities.

       F. EPA must prioritize further research on cumulative impacts and address those impacts
          in its environmental justice analyses

       In preparing environmental justice analyses of its rules, EPA staff must also consider
cumulative impacts, i.e., “the impact[s] on the environment which result from the incremental
impact of [an] action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other
actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant
actions taking place over a period of time.”68 As EPA itself notes, minority and low income
populations are in many instances affected by multiple environmental hazards, such as
industrial facilities, landfills, poor housing, leaking underground tanks, pesticides, and
incompatible land uses. Analyzing the effects from these multiple stressors would allow a more
complete evaluation of pollutant risks to specific populations.69

         While, as EPA notes in the Final Guidance, the science supporting cumulative impact
assessments is still evolving, EPA has already undertaken significant efforts to develop research
on cumulative impacts, and should apply it in elaborating EJ analyses of its rules. It is critical to
consider the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors when assessing health impacts, including
a population’s exposure to multiple pollutants, exposure to higher levels of multiple pollutants,
and chronic exposure to lower levels of multiple pollutants. This is particularly true when
evaluating sensitive sub-groups such as minority communities and low-income communities
that frequently experience higher exposure to air pollution and other disproportionate
impacts.70 As noted above, minority and low income communities are more likely to live or
work near sources of pollution, which is only exacerbated by factors such as health care access,
housing market dynamics, and predisposed traits.71 These higher pollution burdens are
associated with adverse health outcomes such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, low
birth weight, and premature mortality.72

        Controlled human exposure studies are valued for their ability to control and eliminate
confounding factors such as temperature, co-pollutants, or allergens, and the epidemiological
studies EPA relies upon are subjected to rigorous statistical analysis to control for confounding
effect of multiple pollutant exposures.73 Yet in the real world, physiological impacts are likely to
be even worse than what is experienced in the exposure studies because of the addition of
these other factors. The combined effects among air pollutants produce important
physiological effects.74 Air pollutants are inhaled as a mixture of different sources, yet focus has
historically been placed on monitoring and regulating individual pollutants in isolation.75

        In conducting its EJ analyses, EPA should draw on its own Framework for Cumulative
Risk Assessment and prior cumulative impacts analyses, such as the one prepared in the
context of the DSW rule. EPA may also rely on its own guidance for the agency’s review of
NEPA documents. Although focused on the analysis of projects on ecological resources, the
agency could consider the same principles as applied to socioeconomic and human health
issues, particularly with respect to the identification of areas cumulatively impacted by a given
measure, the delineation of geographic and time boundaries, the identification of all relevant
past activities into the affected environment, the utilization of qualitative and quantitative

 thresholds to determine degradation and cumulative impacts, and the incorporation of
mitigation measures to avoid or reduce the severity of those impacts.76

        There are many programs and tools to evaluate different components of risk
assessments, for example, the Community-Based Technical Support Forum, an EPA workgroup
on technical issues that supports community-based risk assessments; EPA’s Community Action
for a Renewed Environment (“CARE”) program, which addresses risk mitigation needs, and the
Office of Research and Development’s (“ORD”) National Exposure Research Laboratory’s
(“NERL”), which develops and applies exposure models and tools to conduct cumulative
exposure assessments, both with respect to health impact and other stressors. 77 NERL is also
developing the Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (“C-FERST”), which will
help identify environmental issues and prioritize exposure and risk reduction efforts based on
EPA’s best available information.78 Furthermore, EPA’s Community Cumulative Assessment Tool
(“CCAT”), currently under development, will use information from C-FERST in order to inform
the public about the process and complexities of assessing cumulative impacts. 79 To the extent
EPA needs more community-level information to prepare a comprehensive “cumulative
effects” analysis, it should ask the states to provide it in their own environmental justice
analyses in state plans.80 EPA must, however, continue to prioritize the development of
research on cumulative impacts.

     G. Comments on EPA’s environmental justice screening tools

       EPA has a breadth of environmental justice screening tools that can help to integrate EJ
considerations in its rules and in “up-front” actions that support the development of those
regulations, as the Final Guidance provides.81 EPA recently launched EJSCREEN, a new
environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides demographic and
environmental information for a selected geographic area. The tool combines environmental
and demographic indicators into “EJ indexes” to identify potential exposure and susceptibility

   In a separate rulemaking, EPA should issue a cumulative impacts standard that fully recognizes the
existence of these effects on minority and low income communities, providing guidance to states, or any
other obligated entity under its rules, to identify and address cumulative impacts in all their programs,
policies, and activities.

 to air and water pollution and other environmental risks in a selected location. EJSCREEN’s
main purpose is to provide a nationally consistent tool that EPA, other agencies, and the public
can use to understand demographic and environmental characteristics of different locations
defined by the tool users.82 Sierra Club recognizes EJSCREEN as an extremely valuable tool, in
particular because it summarizes information in percentiles, allowing users to compare
environmental information for a selected geographic area to that of the state, EPA region, or
the country. Below we offer specific comments on how to further improve this screening tool.
We also ask EPA not to discontinue EJView.

     1. EPA must prioritize the completion of NATA assessment updates to finalize EJSCREEN

         EJSCREEN contains 12 environmental indicators, some of which quantify proximity to
sources of exposure to pollutants, and others which estimate ambient levels of air pollutants.
Available indicators for air pollution include particulate matter and ozone. Available indicators
relevant to a proximity analysis include traffic proximity and volume (amount of nearby
vehicular traffic and distance from roads), lead paint (percentage of housing units built before
1960), and proximity to waste and hazardous chemical facilities and sites (National Priorities
List, Risk Management Plan Facilities, Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage and Disposal
Facilities, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharges, which have been
calculated from various EPA databases.83 The data for these indicators ranges between 2011
and 2013. We note that the tool will have to be updated periodically to reflect the latest
information available. In addition, EPA has not yet made available several indicators from EPA’s
National Air Toxics Assessments (“NATA”), including cancer risks, neurological hazard,
respiratory hazard, and diesel particulate matter.84 Sierra Club urges EPA to prioritize the
completion of these assessment updates so that EJSCREEN can be finalized.

     2. EPA should add SO₂ to EJSCREEN’s environmental indicators

       With respect to EJSCREEN’s available indicators, Sierra Club urges EPA to add sulfur
dioxide (SO₂) to the list of environmental indicators provided by this tool. Exposure to SO₂ in
even very short time periods—even five minutes—has significant health impacts and causes
decrements in lung function, aggravation of asthma, and respiratory and cardiovascular
morbidity.85 SO₂ pollution can have local impacts on minority and low income communities

 located in proximity to large sources of SO₂ pollution. Its impacts can also extend far beyond
those communities, affecting the health of other populations.

       3. EPA must provide detailed guidance on its intended uses of EJSCREEN

       The EJ 2020 Framework clarifies that EJSCREEN is a “screening” tool; i.e., EPA uses it as a
preliminary step to identify areas that may be candidates for additional consideration, analysis
or outreach as the agency develops programs that affect EJ communities. In EJSCREEN’s
website, EPA indicates that the tool is not used to “label” an area as an EJ community; to
quantify specific risk values for a selected area; to measure cumulative impacts of multiple
hazards; or as a basis for agency decision making regarding the existence or absence of EJ
concerns.86 Sierra Club, however, believes that the tool can be used to identify low-income and
minority communities suffering disproportionate impacts, without having to formally “label” or
categorize them as EJ communities. Identifying populations of concern would help agency staff
to ensure the agency avoids adverse impacts from their actions and to target the distribution of
benefits from its rules.

        In its website, EPA also states that the tool is used to help inform outreach to
communities; implement aspects of permitting, enforcement, compliance, and voluntary
programs; enhance geographically-based initiatives, and develop retrospective reports of EPA
work.87 EPA must provide clarity on how exactly the tool is used in permitting and enforcement
processes, so that the public can comment and provide further input on additional ways the
tool could be utilized in these contexts. Training communities in how to use EJSCREEN will also
empower them to participate more meaningfully in the actual permitting process. Sierra Club
also urges EPA to provide guidance to its staff and to states on how to use EJSCREEN in EJ
analyses in the rule making context.

       4. EPA must provide guidance on how to use EJSCREEN for cumulative impacts analyses

        Sierra Club believes that EJSCREEN provides valuable information on cumulative impacts
by displaying pollution data and data on proximity to sites of concern as percentiles, which
allows users to determine how pollution and air quality in a selected area compares to that of
the relevant state, the relevant region, and the country as a whole. For example, as shown in
Figure 6 below, the EJSCREEN report for Eckert Station Power Plant in Michigan indicates that
the levels of PM₂.₅ within 5-miles of the plant are worse than in 79 percent of the state.
Moreover, populations living within 5 miles of the Eckert plant are in closer proximity to other
sites of concern than the majority of people living in Michigan. The population living within 5
miles of the plant is also in closer proximity to Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs)
than 76 percent of the state; to National Priorities List (NPL) sites than 94 percent of the state;
to Risk Management Plan (RMP) sites than 78 percent of the state; and to Major Direct Water

 Dischargers than 88 percent of the state. EJSCREEN, however, does not allow mapping all these
indicators together, which would be useful for a cumulative impacts screening. (See Figure 7).
Sierra Club believes that EJSCREEN’s mapping tool would be more useful if users could visualize
the EJ indexes both individually and cumulatively.

      5. EPA must reassess EJSCREEN’s limitations regarding demographic information

       EPA has indicated that EJSCREEN does have important limitations in so far as it is not a
detailed risk analysis; there is uncertainty in the data provided; and it does not examine the full
range of issues relevant to an environmental justice analysis. On the second aspect, Sierra Club
notes that the source of all demographic data (for the Printable Standard Reports) appears to
be the American Community Survey five-year summary file and the 2010 Census.88 In its
website, EPA correctly warns that EJSCREEN’s demographic estimates involve substantial
uncertainty, particularly when looking at small geographic areas such as Census blocks groups
because these estimates come from surveys and are uncertain.89

        Sierra Club has compared the demographic data in EJSCREEN’s various reports (Printable
Standard Report, 2010 Census Report, and ACS Report, but not 2000 Census Report) with
demographic data obtained using Alteryx’s “Site Selection” application,90 an online geographic
information tool that allows users to define a study area using radii or driving times in order to
generate detailed reports on demographic trends for that area. Alteryx demographics’ tools
have been used in the past for environmental justice analyses, most notably in NAACP’s “Coal
Blooded” report.91 Alteryx’s Site Selection also uses census block-level data from the 2010 U.S.
Census, which is the smallest scale on which the U.S. Census collects demographic data. Site
Selection produces individual reports for each selected location that display 2010 Census
information as well as 2014 and 2019 estimates. For 2010 demographic information, the tool
draws not only from the ACS, but also from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Population
Estimates and the Current Population Survey (CPS).92

        Alteryx’s Site Selection reports display different population counts for larger geographic
areas when compared with EJSCREEN results. EJSCREEN various reports also display different
population counts, depending on the report selected by the user. By way of example, Figures 8,
9, and 10 below display population numbers for Mount Storm Power Plant in West Virginia, as
well as Eckert Station and River Rouge Power Plant in Michigan within a half-mile, 1 mile, 3
mile, 5 mile and 25 mile radius using both Site Selection and EJSCREEN’s various reports. As
noted, Site Selection displays different population numbers than EJSCREEN. Sierra Club urges
EPA to explain in detail how EJSCREEN calculates population counts when users define larger
areas, offer guidance to users on how to select specific types of reports and why, provide more
detailed information on margins of error, contrast this information with other available tools,
and adjust its population calculations if necessary. EPA has already acknowledged that there is
uncertainty in its estimates of smaller areas and has instead suggested using EJSCREEN by

 defining larger areas in buffer reports.93 But, as Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 show, it appears that
the tool cannot obtain population counts (or generate reports) for larger radii that is still
relevant for the assessment of certain air pollutants that travel long distances. Providing the
most accurate population numbers possible is critical as this information underlies the tool’s EJ
Indexes.

     6. CalEnviroScreen 2.0 provides good lessons on additional information that EPA could
        incorporate into EJSCREEN

         To further strengthen EJSCREEN we suggest EPA to again review the design of the
California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool (“CalEnviroScreen 2.0”), which
California state and local agencies use to identify communities that are disproportionately
burdened by different sources of pollution and better direct their resources and programs.
CalEnviroScreen 2.0 uses a myriad of environmental indicators, including ozone, PM₂.₅, diesel
particulate matter, drinking water contaminants, pesticide use, toxic releases from facilities,
traffic density, clean-up sites, groundwater threats, hazardous waste generators and facilities,
impaired water bodies, and solid waste sites and facilities. It also provides information on
health and socioeconomic indicators, including age (to distinguish children and elderly
populations), asthma rates, low birth weight infants, educational attainment, linguistic
isolation, poverty, and unemployment.94 The demographic data is derived from roughly 8,000
census tracts (from the 2010 Census) throughout the state.95 This tool compiles all of the
different indicators when evaluating a particular location, and ranks zip codes statewide for
comparison.

        EJSCREEN relies on most but not all of these indicators. To the extent that some of the
additional indicators of CalEnviroScreen 2.0 are also available in national databases or this
information can be collected from state level health agencies (for example, asthma-related
information), EPA should incorporate these indicators to EJSCREEN, particularly if those
indicators can help to prioritize clean-up and abatement projects. In addition,
CalEnviroScreen’s scores are, to a degree, based on available scientific literature on
environmental pollutants, risk assessment principles (in particular that some populations, such
as children, may be 10 times more sensitive to certain chemical exposures), and established risk
scoring systems quantifying risks by both the relevant threat and the vulnerability to it. To the

 extent that these principles have not yet been incorporated in EJSCREEN’s calculation of EJ
indexes, EPA should integrate them into the relevant formulas used.

      7. EPA should not discontinue EJView

       EPA’s EJView website states that EJView will be taken down in September 2015.96 Sierra
Club urges EPA not to do so. EJView provides valuable information on cumulative impacts in
terms of the actual number of potential sources of pollution, by tallying total sites/facilities and
environmental concerns in a selected area based on sources that report to EPA under various
programs. For example, according to the EJView report for Eckert Station in Michigan, there
are 879 sites and facilities and 35 environmental concerns within 5 miles of this power plant.
More specifically, EJView identifies 726 hazardous waste sites reporting to EPA, as well as 26
impaired streams within the said radius. In this area there are also 121 schools, 5 hospitals and
147 places of worship. Schools, in particular, suggest that children may be subject to adverse
exposures to pollutants that need to be studied further.

       Cross-referencing EJView’s number of environmental concerns and sites with the
population information generated in EJSCREEN (which appears to be the same population
information available in EJView), we find that 710 people live within the 5 mile radius and are
potentially exposed to pollution risks that need to be analyzed further. We appreciate the
feature in EJView maps that allows users to click on the relevant objects in a map and be
redirected to the relevant EPA databases in order to gather detailed information on those sites
and concerns, which does not exist in EJSCREEN.

        Some of the databases where EJView and EJSCREEN draw their information for the
analysis of proximity impacts overlap; for example, it appears that both tools use RCRAInfo,
which contains information reported by hazardous waste generators, transporters, treaters,
storers, and disposers of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
including information on releases and clean-ups, as well as the Permit Compliance System
(PCS), which contains information collected under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit program. But there seem to be other databases used by EJView that
have not been incorporated into EJSCREEN; for example, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI),
which contains information about hundreds of toxic chemicals that are being used,
manufactured, treated, transported, or released into the environment, as well as the
Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES) database, which captures
data reported by grantees on environmental activities (assessment, cleanup and
redevelopment) under the Brownfields Program.

       EJView’s ability to visualize all these concerns in a single map (individually or together,
as chosen by the user) is very helpful to provide communities a full picture of potential
cumulative impacts that need to be analyzed further. (See Fig. 12 below for an example). We
urge EPA to not discontinue EJView unless it incorporates this aspect of the tool and any other

 databases that have not yet been incorporated into EJSCREEN. Furthermore, as noted, EPA
must ensure EJSCREEN’s (and EJView’s) population estimates are accurate, so that EJView
reports can be compared to the specific populations that these sites and concerns are
potentially affecting.

Eckert Station is represented by the pink cross in the center of the map. Green squares represent
hazardous waste sites; light blue squares are toxic release sites; dark blue squares represent sources of
air emissions; and orange squares are brownfields. The houses with flags are schools; the yellow houses
are churches, and the letter “H” depicts hospitals. This map shows that there is a school 0.15 miles
southeast of the facility, which raises concerns that children may be exposed to various environmental
hazards that need to be further evaluated.

      H. EPA must continue to ensure meaningful involvement of minority and low income
         communities in regulatory actions

        EO 12898 requires federal agencies to conduct their programs, policies, and activities
that substantially affect human health or the environment, in a manner that ensures that such
programs, policies, and activities do not have the effect of excluding persons from participation
in these actions, denying them the benefits of those actions, or subjecting them to
discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin.97 EO 12898 also seeks to
promote public participation by requiring federal agencies to ensure that public documents,
notices, and hearings are concise, understandable, and readily accessible to the public” and
encouraging them to translate crucial public documents, notices, and hearings for limited
English speaking populations.98

          In furtherance of these requirements, the Final Guidance provides that “meaningful
involvement” means that communities whose health or environment would be potentially
affected by a regulatory action should have an appropriate opportunity to participate in and
influence those decisions, and that rule-writers and decision-makers should reach out and
facilitate the involvement of those populations potentially affected by the agency’s actions.99
The Guidance emphasizes that public involvement from minority and low income populations,
as well as tribes and indigenous peoples, works best when rule writers consult with these
communities early and often so that they can obtain relevant information on their needs and
vulnerabilities. To the extent possible, these populations should have a meaningful role in
designing the regulatory action.100

       Sierra Club commends EPA for arranging outreach opportunities for communities to
obtain their input in the design of recently proposed rules, and for organizing visits by
communities to the agency’s campus in Research Triangle Park. We urge the agency to
continue providing these communities with opportunities for meaningful involvement in the
process of developing regulatory actions and to increase these opportunities to the extent
possible. EPA should also do trainings for environmental justice communities to educate and
inform them on the public health and environmental impacts of its actions (both in terms of
potential adverse impacts as well as distribution of benefits, as discussed above). EPA’s Final
Guidance encourages rule writers to develop a formal public involvement plan early in the rule
making process.101 Sierra Club believes that this public involvement plan must become an
integral part of every regulatory action by the agency.

        Finally, EPA’s obligations under EO 12898 also involve public participation from tribes
(whether federally-recognized or not) as environmental justice communities. As part of this
mandate, EPA must ensure public participation by a broad range of tribal stakeholders (not just
tribal officials, which EPA is required to consult with under EO 13175, including community and
neighborhood groups; traditional leaders (elders); community service, environmental, and
other non-governments organizations; academic institutions; and religious communities.

       II.    EPA must ensure that environmental justice concerns are adequately addressed in
             the operating permit process102

        EPA must ensure that environmental justice concerns are adequately addressed in the
operating permit process through the implementation and enforcement of emission limitations
that fully comply with applicable EPA’s standards for the regulation of pollution set forth in
state implementation plans. For example, under Title V of the Clean Air Act all major stationary
sources of air pollution are required to apply for operating permits.103 Title V permits must
provide for all federal and state regulations in one legally enforceable document, thereby
ensuring that all Clean Air Act requirements are applied to the facility and that the facility is in
compliance with those requirements.104 These permits must include emission limitations and
other conditions necessary to assure a facility’s continuous compliance with all applicable
requirements of the Act, including the requirements of any applicable state implementation
plan.105 Title V permits must contain monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and other
requirements to assure continuous compliance by sources with emission control
requirements.106 It is unlawful for any person to violate any requirement of a Title V operating
permit.107

        Under Title V of the Act, EPA establishes the minimum elements that must be included
in the operating permit programs, and assists states and local governments in developing their
programs.108 EPA is responsible for overseeing the implementation of permit programs and
may object to a permit that fails to comply with the program requirements. The agency is also
required to establish a federal permit program in any area where the relevant permitting
authority fails to develop and maintain an adequate operating program.109

       Below we discuss the results of Sierra Club’s modeling of the permitted maximum
allowable SO₂ emission limits of select coal plants, which shows that facilities’ permitted SO₂

    Sierra Club endorses the comments of the Human Rights Defense Center on the EJ 2020 Framework,
which urge EPA to prioritize the provision of the environmental protections intended under EO 12898 to
prisoner populations and their families, the great majority of whom are low income and people of
color.102 HRDC’s “Prison Ecology” Project has conducted extensive research to understand how
environmental justice criteria have been applied to prisoner populations, particularly in the permitting
process, noting that EPA does not take prisoners into account as local residents of the regions where
they are incarcerated in assessing environmental impacts from land use decisions on siting the prison
facilities. Human Rights Defense Center, Comment on the inclusion of prisoner populations in EPA’s Draft

 emission limits can be dramatically higher than what is necessary to adequately protect human
health. The modeling shows that the permitted emission limits caused violations of the 1-hour
SO₂ NAAQS, which not only threatens public health but also disproportionately affects EJ
communities. Thus, developing permits with restrictive limits is essential to protecting EJ
communities, and EPA must play a critical role in this effort.

        Specifically, Sierra Club used AERMOD software to model the permitted allowable SO₂
emission limit for the Potomac River Generation Station in Alexandria, Virginia. The plant has
now retired, but the analysis is useful to understand how allowable emission limits under valid
permits can create adverse impacts to EJ communities. In this modeling, the resulting SO₂
plume map overwhelmingly demonstrated that the station’s emissions were causing violations
of the 1-hour SO₂ NAAQS in not only the local area but also in neighboring Maryland and D.C.
More specifically, the plant was causing violations in D.C.’s Ward 8, which has been consistently
the poorest ward of D.C. and predominantly (93.5%) black.110 Ward 8 also, perhaps not
surprisingly, has consistently had the highest asthma emergency department visits for children,
adults and the elderly.111

       Similarly, for the Baltimore area Sierra Club used AERMOD to model the permitted
allowable SO₂ emission limit for the Crane Generating Station in Bowleys Quarters, Maryland,
currently in operation. The SO₂ plume map displayed massive violations of the 1-hour SO₂
NAAQS, including impacts on over 130 schools and Baltimore City, an environmental justice
community. As described previously, Baltimore City is a predominantly black county, and it has
the highest asthma rates and highest poverty rate in all of Maryland.

 poverty rate in Massachusetts.112 Holyoke is also a predominantly Hispanic community, with a
Hispanic overrepresentation of nearly 40% and a nearly 30% underrepresentation of whites
compared to the state average.113 Holyoke’s age-adjusted asthma emergency room visit rate is
nearly four times higher the state age-adjusted rate114 and within that metric, Hispanics had by
far the highest rate (up to triple) compared to all other races. Moreover, Hispanics were over
2.5 times as likely to go to the emergency room for asthma if they lived in Holyoke compared to
the rest of the state. Even more disturbingly, Holyoke’s age-adjusted asthma mortality rate is
triple the state rate, and the asthma mortality rate for Hispanics in Holyoke in particular is four
times the state rate.

EPA should work with states in developing stringent permits to realize the environmental and
public health protections intended by the agency’s rules, to protect overburdened
communities, and to meet its EJ goals under its EJ 2020 Framework.

       III.   EPA must effectively incorporate EJ concerns in reviewing and approving amended
             state plans and enforcing the requirements of the SSM rule under those plans

        The Clean Air Act requires states to craft state implementation plans to meet Clean Air
Act requirements, including the requirement to ensure attainment and maintenance of the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).115 However, many plans contain illegal
exemptions and affirmative defenses that allow polluters to exceed federally-applicable
emission limitations during startup, shutdown, malfunction (“SSM”) events without
consequences. These SSM loopholes undermine the emission limits in state plans, threaten
states’ abilities to achieve and maintain compliance with the NAAQS, and endanger public
health and public welfare. These provisions also undermine other requirements of the Act,
including Prevention of Significant Deterioration increments, nonattainment plans, and visibility
requirements. Ignoring emissions during SSM events undermines the entire state operating
program because for years there has been no check on whether SSM events are violating EPA’s
standards or the facilities’ applicable permits.

         The pollution caused by these events often exceeds the routine pollution levels emitted
by a source during normal operations. However, because of the SSM loopholes in state plans,
facilities have been effectively exempted from permit limits or face no penalties for these large
emissions. Excessive pollution during SSM events from large facilities has devastating impacts
on surrounding communities, which are often minority or low income communities. During
these events, the facility can emit a toxic mix of pollutants, which the community bears witness
to, as described below.

        On May 22, 2015, EPA issued a final rule –the SSM Emissions Rule—which requires
states to fix these unlawful loopholes in their state plans implementing the NAAQS.116 The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently evaluated the validity of an affirmative defense
provision in EPA’s NESHAP for manufacturers of Portland cement, holding that affirmative
defense provisions in EPA’s regulations are inconsistent with Clean Air Act requirements
because the Act gives citizens the right to have a court determine whether violators should be
penalized for not taking reasonable precautions to avoid upset events that cause
disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities.117 In issuing this rule to ensure that
states have implementation plans that are fully compliant with Clean Air Act requirements and
are consistent with recent court decisions, EPA has identified loopholes in the state plans of 36
states and issued a “SIP call” to direct them to correct the relevant SSM provisions in their

 plans. States have until November 22, 2016 to propose the relevant revisions.118 EPA must
effectively incorporate EJ concerns in reviewing and approving amended state plans, as well as
in enforcing the requirements of the SSM rule under the approved plans. Below we provide
testimony from members of communities that have been disproportionately affected by these
SSM loopholes. We hope EPA takes these issues into account in evaluating states’ modified
plans, in accordance with EO 12898.

      A. Testimony from members of the Fairmount, Alabama community surrounding the
         Walter Coke Facility

       The federal government has identified environmental justice concerns in North
Birmingham, Alabama.119 Jefferson County, in particular, ranks tenth in the nation for the
highest risk of cancer from toxic air pollution.120 In accordance with the SSM exemptions
allowed under the current Alabama SIP, the operating permit for the Walter Coke facility, which
coke for use in blast furnaces and foundries, allows large excess emissions events to occur
without consequence.121 The Walter Coke facility had at least 80 SSM events from July 2008 to
June 2012, with many spanning several hours, including one for almost 30 hours.122

        Charlie Powell lived very close to the Walter Coke facility for over forty years. His house
and car were regularly covered in soot pollution, so he had to routinely hose off his house and if
he didn’t wash his car weekly, it would accumulate a dense layer of soot that he would have to
scrape off the windows.123 Charlie also developed sleep apnea and other respiratory problems
while living near the facility, and his wife developed cancer. Since moving a few more miles
away from the facility, Charlie’s health has improved and he doesn’t have to sleep hooked up to
a machine as often.124

         Eunice Webb is Charlie Powell’s 70-year old aunt and she blames Walter Coke for a
range of sicknesses that she and her family have suffered.125 She developed asthma after
moving to the area, and she lives with her son, who is very sick, and three of her grandchildren,
one who has asthma and another who suffers from cerebral palsy. One of her sisters has
cancer, both her mom and other sister have suffered from heart attacks, and her husband died
of cancer. Air pollution is particularly bad in the summertime, and while Eunice would like to sit
outside on her porch, she cannot do so because the poor air quality exacerbates her asthma.
The air quality often makes it too difficult for Eunice to go outside at all. She would like to move
away from the area, and has family and friends who have already done so.126

      B. Testimony from members of the Detroit, Michigan community surrounding the
         Marathon Refinery

        The diverse community surrounding the Detroit Marathon Refinery is located in the zip
code with the highest levels of air pollution in the country. One-quarter of the residents live
below the poverty level127 and the community’s cancer and death rates are “significantly
higher” than the rest of the state.128 Since 2001, the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality has issued several air-pollution violations notices to Marathon’s Detroit Refinery, but
nevertheless in 2008 the refinery underwent a $2.2 billion dollar expansion to allow it to
process more high-sulfur tar sands crude oil from Canada.129 Since that expansion, the
community has noticed that flaring events have significantly increased. The Michigan SIP’s SSM
provisions do not discourage constant flaring events because the SIP allows excess emissions
from the facility without penalty. The SIP contains both an enforcement discretion approach to
“excess emissions resulting from malfunction, start-up, or shutdown,” and an affirmative
defense for “excess emissions during start-up or shutdown.”130

         Sherry Griswold has lived within a few hundred feet of this enormous refinery for
21 years, and has raised her children in this home.131 For the last five years, Sherry has been
tormented by relentless flaring from this facility – usually three times every night. Twenty-foot
tall flames shoot out from the flares accompanied by a loud howling sound and a pungent odor.

 Once while Sherry was in her backyard, a flaring event literally knocked her to the ground. Her
house shakes and her ceiling tiles have fallen down during these events. Sherry doesn’t have
her children and grandchildren come over anymore because she is afraid the pollution from the
refinery will impact their health. When the kids did play outside, soot from the flaring would
coat their skin, and was very difficult to wash off.132

      C. Testimony from members of the Shreveport, Louisiana community surrounding
         Calumet Shreveport Refining

       The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality documented over 100 SSM
incidents from 2005 through 2012 at the Calumet Shreveport Refining facility,133 emitting over
320,000 pounds of unpermitted excess air pollution into the community.134 The Calumet
Refinery permit allows excess pollution events and flaring because the SIP contains automatic
and discretionary exemptions for specific pollutants.135 Other conditions and affirmative
defense provisions allow Calumet to escape penalties for excess emissions during SSM
events.136

         Velma White has lived two streets over from Calumet’s massive oil refinery for over 38
years in the Ingleside neighborhood, a predominately African-American, low income
community in Shreveport.137 When Velma White first moved, the Calumet refinery was a much
smaller facility, but it has since expanded from approximately half a block in size to over twelve
blocks. Velma White’s daughter was diagnosed with renal failure at a young age, and many
others in the community suffer from respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, renal
failure, cancer and skin problems, which Velma believes are caused by pollution from the
Calumet refinery. Velma spends much of her time documenting the refinery’s accidents and
upsets: she usually smells strong odors accompanying the flaring ranging from a rotten egg,
sulfuric smell to a more chemical smell, and experiences physical reactions including a burning
sensation in her nose and throat, nausea, and a funny taste in her mouth. These symptoms can
last for days after the flaring. In addition to the smells, Velma has often awakened in the middle
of the night to a loud, roaring noise when the facility is flaring. There also can be a black ash or
debris from the flaring, which on occasion has covered her house and property, and even her
skin.138

       D. Testimony from members of the Port Arthur community surrounding the BASF
         Chemical Plant and the Total Petrochemicals and Refinery

        Hilton Kelley was born in Port Arthur and returned to the area in 2000. He has lived
downwind from the BASF Chemical plant and Total Petrochemicals and Refinery for the past 12
years.139 Port Arthur, where most residents are African American or Hispanic,140 has one of the
highest concentrations of hazardous waste and petrochemical facilities and refineries in the
country. He routinely notices soot on the cars in his neighborhood, and a pungent, sulfurous
odor in the air. His eyes frequently sting and water when he leaves his house, and when the air
smells particularly strong of sulfur, his lips immediately chap and he feels a tingling sensation
on his tongue. He also deals with hypertension, sinus problems, and allergies. He did not suffer
from any of these ailments before moving back to Port Arthur. His 12-year old grandson lives
nearby and spends a lot of time at his house and has, since birth, suffered from respiratory
problems, allergies, and sinus infections. His grandson’s symptoms persist, and worsen when he
spends time outdoors. Hilton had returned home to fight for environmental justice and over
the last couple of years, he helped to successfully relocate families from the housing project
where he spent his childhood, which was located on the fence line of the Valero and Motiva
refineries, to another part of town not directly in harm’s way.


      IV.    EPA must ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by any entity that
             receives funding from the agency

         EPA must ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by any entity that
receives funding from the agency to implement its rules, programs, and policies. Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act (“Title VI”), Section 601, provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on
the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance.”141 Title VI “reaches unintentional, disparate-impact discrimination as well
as deliberate racial discrimination.”142 Title VI, Section 602, requires every federal agency and
department empowered to grant financial assistance to issue regulations to effectuate the
provisions of Section 601.143

       EO 12250, Leadership and Coordination of Nondiscrimination Laws, directs federal
agencies to issue appropriate Title VI implementing directives, either in the form of policy

 guidance or regulations consistent with the requirements prescribed by the Department of
Justice’s Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.144 The presidential memorandum
accompanying EO 12898 also requires federal agencies providing funding to programs or
activities that affect public health or the environment to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act.145

        EPA’s implementing regulations forbid recipients146 of federal funds from using criteria
or methods of administering their programs in a manner that has the effect of discriminating on
the grounds of race, color, national origin, or sex.147 These regulations also preclude a recipient
of federal funds from choosing a site or location for a facility that would result in discriminatory
effects.148 Other EPA’s regulations mandate that state agencies that receive federal funds
maintain Title VI compliance programs for themselves and other recipients that obtain federal
assistance through such programs.149

         State agencies implementing EPA’s rules are responsible for ensuring that EPA-funded
activities (for example, permitting processes) conform to Title VI requirements. If any program
or measure that was funded by EPA resulted in discrimination on the basis of race, color, or
national origin, those agencies would be in violation of Title VI, and aggrieved persons would be
entitled to file an administrative complaint with EPA.150

         Title VI cannot be just a “related effort;”151 it needs to be an integral part of EPA’s EJ
2020 Framework. EPA must prioritize and devote additional resources to Title VI compliance
and enforcement. As part of this process, Sierra Club reiterates EPA’s need to make
modifications to the complaint investigation and resolution process in a manner that ensures
meaningful participation of environmental justice communities and effective enforcement of
Title VI complaints.152

         In addition, if compliance cannot be achieved voluntarily, the regulations authorize EPA
to deny, suspend or terminate funding to the particular program under which the agency has
found discrimination. EPA may also refer the matter to the Department of Justice to ensure
compliance.153 EPA should make use of this authority if any program funded by the agency
results in a Title VI violation. EPA should also finalize its “Draft Title VI Guidance for EPA
Assistance Recipients Administering Environmental Permitting Programs” and its “Draft Revised
Guidance for Investigating Title VI Administrative Complaints Challenging Permits.”

         Meaningful public involvement is also necessary to ensure recipients’ compliance with
Title VI. As EPA notes in its Title VI’s “Recipient Guidance,” early and inclusive public
involvement of environmental justice communities in the permitting process is critical to ensure
that the use of federal funds does not discriminate against these communities on the basis of
race, color, or national origin.154 In this guidance, EPA has suggested specific public
involvement approaches in the permitting process, which could also inform the development of
environmental rules. As noted above, the Final Guidance directs rule writers to develop formal
public involvement plans to ensure the participation of EJ communities in the making and
implementation of the agency’s rules.

         Specifically, Title VI “Recipient Guidance” encourages the preparation of a “public
involvement plan” with the participation of environmental justice communities.155 The
guidance also suggests equipping communities with appropriate tools such as information
materials, training sessions (including in other languages, if there are non-English speaking
communities), and grants to ensure their active and effective participation in the plan
development process.156 Finally, funding recipients should work to ensure that local authorities
integrate environmental justice concerns early in the process, which will require acknowledging
communities’ concerns about existing facilities near residential areas; working with the relevant
authorities to ensure that data on demographics and location of existing facilities in
communities are considered before making any siting decisions; and working with those
authorities to identify locations for new facilities that avoid net increases in pollution in
communities with disproportionately high exposure or that already host a number of
facilities.”157

Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator Charles Lee

USEPA, Office of Environmental Justice (2201‐A) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington,, DC 20460

Dear Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator Lee,

I am responding to the EPA's request for comments to the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. I appreciate EPA's
efforts through Plan EJ
2014 to integrate environmental justice into all its programs and particularly to build environmental justice into
enforcement targeting and enforcement cases.

For decades, tribal areas, communities of color, and low‐income populations have been experiencing disproportionate
impacts of pollution. This pollution affects impacted individual's health and quality of life daily and in the long‐term,
including children who suffer physical and cognitive development delays due to this pollution.
In places like Wayne County, Michigan, a portion of which has been titled ""the Epicenter of Asthma Burden"" by the
Michigan Department of Health, 92 schools lie in communities where children are exposed to air pollution that affects
their ability to learn.

I urge you to adopt an additional element under the goal to ""Demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to
overburdened communities."" Where federal authority exists and state government has failed to address environmental
justice issues, the EPA should act without delay to address issues in overburdened communities. An example of this
situation already exists in Wayne County Michigan, an area that failed to meet federal minimum standards for sulfur
dioxide
(SO2) pollution. There the state put aside an effort to finalize a state implementation plan that, with a few changes,
would have brought the region into attainment; instead the state allowed the polluting industries to dictate pollution
levels through a draft permit process that provided grossly inadequate SO2 reductions. The timeline for Michigan to
produce a state plan has long passed, and people in the Wayne County continue to suffer.

Thank you for helping ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency achieves real outcomes that matter to
overburdened communities.
Environmental justice delayed is justice denied.

Sincerely,

Eric Keller

In Nueces County we have never had a good health survey.

We need help with the Clean Water Act.

We need an EJ representative to come more often to visit colonias and talk to residents about
our problems. We don’t even know who EJ Representative for our area is.

We need help placing more of our colonias placed on the S.O.S. website.

Executive Order 12898 – Federal agencies to address the disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects of their programs on minority and low-income
population.

How can we advance when we, in some of our colonias don’t even have mail delivered to their
homes.

We need help with sewage systems when the colonias get flooded the septic tanks over flow
on the inside of the houses.

NEEDED:

Have classes to educate our residents!

We have no community centers in Nueces County.

We have two toxic injection sites that bring toxic materials even from Mexico and all over the
states. One site is within ¼ of a mile from a neighborhood. The other site across the street
with no monitors.

Roads in some of our colonias are so bad the school children have trouble walking to the bus
stop even in good weather.

E.J. 2020 also needs bilingual people when it comes to teaching classes in our area.

 Our most important asset that we have is our children and often our children are sick because
of the environment, water they drink or air they breathe. The soil they play on is contaminated
with pesticides.

             Public Comment re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

Dear Mr. Lee:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework.


The Southeastern North Carolina Environmental Justice Coalition is an all‐volunteer
organization founded in 2014 to address the rampant environmental injustice in Southeastern
North Carolina, in the Wilmington regional area. Our Coalition members are the New Hanover
County NAACP, the North Carolina Coastal Federation, Cape Fear RiverWatch, PenderWatch &
Conservancy, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help (REACH), the Cape Fear
(NC) Chapter of the Sierra Club and the Duke University Environmental Justice Clinic. Our
member organizations have approximately 15,000 members. Among the most pressing of the
numerous EJ issues in our region are the proposed Carolinas Cement (aka Titan Cement) kiln
and quarry, the Duke Energy coal ash pond with its leaks, the massive pollution caused by the
CAFO hog farms in many eastern North Carolina counties and the superfund sites at Navassa,
NC. Our air, aquifers and the Cape Fear River or its tributaries are grossly polluted or
threatened with pollution by all of these.


 We are very grateful for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework for EJ 2020. In
particular, we would like to draw your attention to a pressing need ‐ and excellent opportunity ‐
for EPA to meet its goal to “Engage states and other co‐regulators in environmental justice,”
particularly with regards to permitting, by using the pending NC Division of Air Quality permit
for Carolinas Cement Company as a test case.

                                      Page 1 of 4
Engaging states and other co‐regulators in environmental justice
EPA can meet its over‐arching goal to “make a visible difference for over‐burdened
communities” by addressing the points under Goal I, “Deepen environmental justice practice
within EPA programs to improve the health and environment of overburdened communities.”
Nearly every environmental permit issued is an opportunity to do just that. EPA’s focus on
considering environmental justice in EPA permitting decisions is well‐placed; however, only a
tiny fraction of permits are actually issued by EPA. Most permits are issued by state agencies or
tribal governments. Many of these state permitting staffs – including those in North Carolina ‐‐
issued the very permits that created current Environmental Justice hotspots. Environmental
Justice will not be considered in most environmental permitting decisions unless EPA strongly
supports ‐ or even compels ‐ states to do so. We urge EPA to focus on advancing the
engagement of states in considering and implementing environmental justice:

    ● Require Environmental Justice training for state agency staff members and leaders
        under cooperative agreements
EPA has completed mandatory training on Environmental Justice for all employees, according to
the Plan EJ 2020 Draft Action Agenda Framework. Congratulations on this important
achievement! Many state agency staff are in dire need of training on environmental justice as
well. State agency representatives in North Carolina, and presumably in many other states, are
unclear about what environmental justice is, why it is important, and how to consider or
implement it in their jobs. North Carolina serves as a key example, as it no longer even has a
coordinator for Environmental Justice within the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. In other words, no one at NC’s DENR considers EJ issues in evaluating permits, which
is appalling. We suggest that EPA require all state agency staff involved in permitting and
enforcement to receive mandatory environmental justice training under the terms of their
cooperative agreements with EPA. States like PA, CT and IL, which have shown leadership in
implementing environmental justice principles, could be tapped to help provide these trainings,
so that the message is peer‐to‐peer and thus more likely to be well‐received by states. Such an
approach would also help meet EPA’s goal to “Collaborate with states, tribes, local
governments and other co‐regulators to share and develop environmental justice tools and
practices” (EJ 2020 Draft Framework).

   ● Guide states to consider Environmental Justice and develop hooks that compel them
       to do so
 There are likely multiple barriers that prevent states from considering and implementing
 Environmental Justice in their permitting and regulatory functions. These barriers may include




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                        328
                                       Page 2 of 4

 a lack of understanding of the principles of environmental justice (see previous bullet point), a
 perceived lack of resources or specialized knowledge to implement environmental justice,
 pressure from regulated entities to speed up regulatory processes in ways that could preclude
 full consideration of environmental justice, or others. EPA should identify and address these
 barriers through education and training, guidance materials, and by compelling states to
 consider Environmental Justice in permitting and enforcement whenever possible, such as
 under cooperative agreements or other funding mechanisms. For example, EPA could adapt
 the Agency’s guidance “Considering Environmental Justice in Permitting” for state use, and
 provide direct assistance in using such a tool. EPA could require states to make use of the
 guidance as a condition of specific funding / cooperative agreements.

     ● Use the Carolinas Cement Company air permit as a test case under EJ 2020 to move a
         state to thoroughly consider and implement environmental justice principles in a state
         permitting decision.
EPA has an excellent opportunity to help a state make considerable progress by learning
hands‐on how to use the principles of Environmental Justice in permitting. In issuing an air
permit to Carolinas Cement Company in 2013 (a permit that is currently before the North
Carolina Supreme Court), an endeavor that would build one of the world’s largest cement
plants in an over‐burdened community of poor and minority residents on the Northeast Cape
Fear River on the border of New Hanover and Pender Counties, near Wilmington, North
Carolina. State regulators summarily rejected the community’s many requests to consider
environmental justice factors in its permit analysis. Our member organizations have submitted
critical comments about the proposed permit, and we have communicated our concerns about
environmental justice with regards to this permit to NC DENR and to EPA’s Region IV
Environmental Justice staff members.

The NC DENR Division of Air Quality held a public hearing on the revised permit in 2013, at
which our member organizations the New Hanover County NAACP and PenderWatch as well as
several other community representatives urged the state to consider the special vulnerabilities
of the nearby community reliant on well water, already overburdened by legacy contamination
from present and historical polluters on the Northeast Cape Fear River. Despite our specific
requests to do so, the Division of Air Quality flatly refused to consider any secondary impacts of
the permit, from air deposition of mercury and heavy metals into an impaired waterway, to the
tremendous increases in heavy truck traffic that would accompany the opening of a massive
cement plant. The hearing officer also publicly belittled community members for urging the

Division of Air Quality to consider environmental justice in their permitting decision. Quoting
the hearing officer’s written report:

        “Commenters appear to allege that the federal Environmental Justice policy
        applies to NC DAQ’s issuance of this permit. The federal policy, set forth in Federal
        Executive Order No. 12898, addresses the federal government’s responsibilities
        only, not the State’s. Therefore it is not applicable here.” NC DENR

        (http://daq.state.nc.us/permits/psd/docs/titan/CCC_Hearing_Officer_Report.pdf
        page 13).

The Hearing Officer’s opinion was adopted in its totality and the Carolinas Cement Company air
permit issued by Donald Van der Vaart, who was subsequently appointed Secretary of the
North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, where he remains today.
See http://daq.state.nc.us/permits/psd/docs/titan/titan_perm_08292013.pdf

We strongly urge EPA to conduct a thorough review of this permit and use your authority under
the Clean Air Act and other federal laws to give Environmental Justice its due consideration in
this matter. Mr. Lee, we would like to meet with you as well as meet again with Mr. Mustafa
Ali to discuss this proposal. We will contact you separately with a meeting request.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on the EJ 2020 Draft Framework, and for
your diligent work to promote environmental justice. Please contact me at any time for
additional information about the issues which have been raised in this comment letter.

                  Comments on Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
                                            June 12, 2015


We believe the general principles described in the Framework are laudable. Further, we agree
with the three overarching goals. Most of the bulleted items below the three goals are either
directly applicable, or by extension applicable, to the national drinking water program.
However, there are some important distinctions that we believe need to be drawn between EJ
considerations as they apply to drinking water programs as contrasted with their applicability to
other environmental/public health programs. Our overarching and specific comments are as
follows:

Overarching Comments:

National Drinking Water Program Ethic: We believe that drinking water programs with their
""serve and protect everyone"" ethic are quite different from other environmental/public health
programs that may have much more localized issues to address, such as RCRA clean-ups,
wastewater or air pollution emissions, etc. We collectively (EPA, states, and local water
systems) strive to achieve the goal of ensuring that all citizens using public water systems have
access to safe drinking water that meets all health-based requirements all of the time – regardless
of where they work or live. That entails ensuring that public water systems maintain high
compliance rates with National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and any more stringent
state regulations. While some Americans live in areas that are more remote and not yet served
by public water, the vast majority of our citizens drink water from public water systems; and,
even those served by private wells often drink water from public systems at school or at work.
We would suggest that there be some acknowledgement in the Framework of these differences.

Specific Comments:

       Please Qualify “Rulemaking” and “Permitting” (as used in Section I. A & B): We
        believe that, when the Framework uses the term “rulemaking”, it’s actually referring to
        rules regarding wastewater, hazardous waste, and air pollutant discharges, not public
        health protection rules. We suggest that the Framework draw that distinction clearly.

       Aggregate Weight of Environmental & Public Health Costs/Balancing Compliance
        Costs of Environmental/Public Health Requirements: It may be useful for the
        Framework to acknowledge that certain communities may be overburdened by the
        combined weight of environmental and public health regulations. In some instances,
        costs imposed by environmental regulations to resolve one environmental issue (such as
        CSOs) may well leave a community without sufficient resources to address other issues
        such as drinking water infrastructure. Perhaps the 2nd bullet under Section II. A could be
        broadened to encompass this point. Many rural communities with aging, low-income
        populations have tremendous challenges maintaining existing infrastructure, much less
        taking actions needed to address new regulatory mandates. Many states have



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           24
                                                    2


        implemented state initiatives to try to address this quandary (e.g., no interest loans or
        grants for aging infrastructure, targeted technical assistance/training, etc.) – and, states
        welcome federal partnerships in addressing these challenges. However, state drinking
        water programs do not believe that the protection “bar” should be lowered for
        disadvantaged communities – i.e., subjected to less stringent, less protective
        requirements.

       Collaborative Work Among Federal, State, and Local Government. The last bullet
        in Section II.A indicates that the Agency will: ""Work with states, tribes, local
        governments and other co-regulators to promote consideration of environmental justice in
        our collective decision-making."" We agree with the thrust of this bullet. However, we
        wonder whether, under this approach, there would be an expectation for EPA Regions to
        have a metric/goal for this interaction and, in turn, an expectation placed back on states to
        report back to EPA. If so, we would be concerned about the possible burden of such a
        metric on state programs.

       Priorities in 2015 -- Lead in Drinking Water: The ongoing existence of lead service
        lines and partial lead service lines and issues related to poor maintenance in extensive
        distribution systems could be considered a drinking water EJ issue that collectively needs
        to be addressed – in 2015 and beyond -- by a combination of Federal, state, and local
        efforts.

       Priorities in 2015 -- Available Funds: We wish to learn more about the context for the
        6th bullet on page 5: “Implement Environmental Justice Small Grants and Environmental
        Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement programs.” If there are
        funds available for disadvantaged communities beyond what we typically provide
        through the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds, we’d like to know about and
        share that information.

Re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

Dear Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator Lee:

Spectra Energy Corp (“Spectra” or “Spectra Energy”) submits the following comments and
recommendations on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)’s draft EJ 2020 Action
Agenda framework.1 Spectra supports EPA’s environmental justice efforts but requests that EPA
commit to concrete environmental justice goals and policies that produce predictable outcomes
and expectations for regulated entities.

Spectra Energy is one of North America’s leading pipeline and midstream companies. Based in
Houston, Texas, the company’s operations in the United States and Canada include more than
22,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil pipelines. For nearly a century,
Spectra Energy and its predecessor companies have developed critically important pipelines and
related infrastructure connecting energy supplies to premium markets.

Spectra Energy’s core customers are local distribution companies, marketers and traders, natural
gas producers, gas-fired electric generators, and residential, commercial, and industrial facilities.
Spectra Energy provides infrastructure that is vital to meeting the Nation’s energy demands. The
company is constantly constructing new projects to keep up with the growing demand for oil and
natural gas and maintaining its existing pipeline infrastructure to ensure pipeline safety.

Natural gas plays an increasingly vital role in the United States economy, and interstate pipelines
are essential to that development. The INGAA Foundation, Inc. projects that the United States
and Canada will need to invest an average of $14 billion per year through 2035 on natural gas
midstream assets, including new mainlines, natural gas storage fields, laterals to/from storage,
power plants and processing facilities, gas lease equipment, LNG export facilities, and related

equipment.2 Spectra alone anticipates investing $35 billion by 2020 in much needed
infrastructure. The role of natural gas and need for pipeline construction will only increase in
importance as EPA seeks to achieve other priorities such as the proposed Clean Power Plan.

The siting, construction, and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC
pursuant to the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”). Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which
amended the NGA, FERC is the designated lead agency for NEPA review of interstate natural
gas pipeline projects.3 Before a new interstate natural gas pipeline is constructed or expanded,
FERC must issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity finding that there is a need for
the project and that it is in the public interest. As part of the certificate process, FERC conducts a
thorough review of the proposed pipeline route and environmental impacts under NEPA.
Although FERC is not bound by Executive Order 12,868, FERC’s thorough review includes an
extensive opportunity for meaningful public input and often incorporates environmental justice
considerations.

Pipeline construction projects require an efficient and predictable permitting process in order to
meet construction schedules and the in-service dates demanded by customers. This efficient and
predictable process is of utmost importance to creating the infrastructure necessary to “maintain
our Nation’s competitive edge, and ensure an economy built to last.”4 In this regard, Congress,
the White House, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have all adopted the goal of
efficient permitting for pipeline operations.5

Against this backdrop of clear and stringent regulatory and permitting requirements, Spectra has
at times been concerned with the vagueness of EPA’s environmental justice goals and policies.
Vague environmental justice policies lead to three major problems. First, vague policies do not
provide a roadmap for compliance. The pipeline industry is highly regulated. The schedules
associated with pipeline construction and maintenance require a degree of predictability that

cannot be provided by vague regulatory guidance. Environmental justice guidance should not
leave regulated parties guessing as to compliance requirements. Second, where policies are
unclear, preventable conflicts and associated delays will occur. These delays are particularly
difficult for linear projects like pipelines which are subject to multiple permits and scheduling
constraints. It is not unusual for a large pipeline project to involve multiple state jurisdiction and
multiple federal agency regions/districts. Third, without clear and concrete guidance,
environmental justice policies may be applied inconsistently from one agency official to the next.
Inconsistent application of environmental justice policies undermines predictability and
consistency for regulated entities. Confusion, delay, and inconsistent policy application
negatively impact both environmental justice communities and regulated entities.

Accordingly, Spectra recommends that EPA establish concrete goals and policies that advance
environmental justice while producing predictable outcomes and expectations for regulated
entities. Concrete goals are necessary for the agency to consistently and effectively produce
positive environmental justice outcomes. Predictable outcomes and expectations are necessary
for regulated industries to plan infrastructure investments and effectively partner in advancing
the goal of environmental justice.

Specifically, Spectra submits the following requests. First, the agency should ensure that the EJ
2020 framework incorporates complementary mandates to streamline permitting. As suggested
by Executive Order 13,604, EPA’s environmental justice guidance should be structured to
“provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both project sponsors and affected
communities” and seek to “significantly reduce the aggregate time required to make decisions in
the permitting and review…while improving environmental and community outcomes…”6
Second, the agency should use specific language to describe the effect that environmental justice
considerations will have in different contexts (e.g., compliance) and avoid vague undocumented
goals that do not provide predictability for the regulated community.7 Third, in order to ensure
consistent policy application, the agency should make environmental justice policies clear and
easy to follow for regulators, affected communities, and the regulated public. Finally, the agency
should expressly identify how environmental justice considerations interact with the EPA’s
existing statutory and regulatory requirements and the requirements of other regulatory agencies.

Spectra appreciates the Agency’s willingness to listen and respond to our concerns and
recommendations. Spectra looks forward to working with the leadership and staff of the Office

           Spectra understands that some of these goals will be elucidated in future guidance and looks forward to
participating in those discussions.

To: Charles Lee, Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice, EPA
From: Louise Gorenflo, coordinating secretary, Tennessee Interfaith Power & Light
Re: Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
Date: June 15, 2015

Tennessee Interfaith Power & Light (TIPL) thanks EPA for the opportunity to submit our comments on its Draft
EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. It is of great value that EPA is developing its capacities to advance EJ
through its programs, policies, and activities, as well as engaging other agencies in developing their own
capacities.

It is our understanding, however, that EPA’s commitment to EJ is largely an internal process that does not
extend to states. Certainly EPA encourages states to incorporate EJ in development of SIPs, state regulations,
and state enforcement, but encouragement is not the same as requirement.

Our experience here in Tennessee has taught us that state agencies do not hold EJ in high regard. We have
seen no actual evidence that our state’s agencies have considered EJ in their rulemaking, regulations, and
enforcement.

It is important the EPA has developed its own EJ capacities. However, without developing the capacities of the
states to do the same, we the people do not experience EPA’s efforts making a difference in how states
operate.

After the release of the draft Clean Power Plan, EPA convened conference calls and meetings with many EJ
leaders and public interest groups to affirm EPA’s valuing of EJ. Yet absent within the draft Clean Power Plan
were any requirements that states incorporate EJ into the development of their SIPs.

This disconnect between EPA’s aspirations for EJ and actual requirements for EJ on the state level is reflected
in the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework which recommends not one step towards making states
accountable for EJ in their rulemaking, regulations, or enforcement.

Some states have on their own made EJ part of the way they do business. We live in a state that would not do
so unless it was required to do it.

We encourage EPA to include within its draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework agenda items that would move
EPA in the direction of requiring states to incorporate EJ in their SIPs, regulations, and enforcement.

Thank you.

Part II, Section A
Collaborate with states, tribes, local governments and other co-regulators to share and develop
environmental justice tools and practices

Commissions. There are local and state-level authorities, such as conservation districts and
health commissions, which have intervention and regulatory capacity on behalf of jurisdictions.
For instance, according to Chapter 1515 of the Ohio Revised Code, the state’s Soil and Water
Conservation Commission may “[s]eek the cooperation and assistance of the federal
government or any of its agencies, and of agencies of this state, in the work of the districts …”1
The Ohio Soil and Water Conservation Commission is within the state’s Department of Natural
Resources. Other authorities of interest include the Bureau of Underground Storage Tank
Requirements of the state’s Department of Commerce; the Ohio Minority Health Commission;
and the Utility Radiological Safety Board of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

Marginalization. Though there are governmental and non-governmental authorities, some
perceive themselves as non-traditional partners. A perception problem arises such that potential
mission-compatible partners have relegated 'social justice' issues as a concern not-central to
conservation of natural resources or their main constituents e.g. farmers, exurbs.

Part II, Section C
Support transformative efforts in communities to advance environmental justice through EPA’s
Community Resources Network

Libraries. To ensure the accessibility and continuity of knowledge as federal administrations
and priorities change, local and state libraries may help with archiving the accrued resources
e.g. publications, webinars. This can increase the diffusion of innovation in environmental
justice as well as serve a function as introductory subject matter exposure for community
members and local public officials. Public libraries can serve as a repository of legacy
information and historical data in the Community Resources Network.

Reinvestment. The Community Resources Network could incorporate data about the
performance of financial institutions serving overburdened communities. The Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 enables robust participation of banks via financing, foundation
support, and corporate social responsibility.2 It has been coupled with historic preservation to
revitalize neighborhoods such as the Manchester District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the
Mount Auburn District in Cincinnati, Ohio.3




EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           339
  Part III, Section B
Show positive impacts of our work through community-level results, such as revitalization and
sustainability, partnerships and collaborative problem-solving, and grassroots capacity-building

Depth. Research partners can provide technical assistance and train members of the community
who want to extend their skills in data collection, organizing, and problem-solving.
Collaborators such as universities already collect, refine, and store the type of data associated
with the EJSCREEN. For instance, the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity of
The Ohio State University as well as the Franklin Soil and Water Conservation District have
personnel with geographic information systems capabilities and regularly compile datasets. For
especially overburdened communities, such partners can provide precise and up-to-date data.




Part III, Section D
Develop indicators of progress through collaborative processes with communities, states, tribes and other
stakeholder partners

Metrics. There are ways to demonstrate progress in addition to geographic profiles of the
presence of chemicals of concern. For instance the set of social network analysis metrics
pioneered by Albert-Lázsló Barabási4, Nicholas Christakis5,6, James Fowler5,6, and Andrew
Papachristos7 reveal the extent to which social ties influence health. With respect to the
environmental justice gap, the number of connections and types of partnerships established
with communities across time can show an indication of the trajectory of success in attaining
outcomes and eventual impact.

        Perhaps in evaluating progress in environmental justice, categories of metrics from
different disciplines, such as epidemiology with chronic disease surveillance, can provide a
comprehensive view of progress in environmental justice. Recent public health metrics have
measurements that show mediating factors in the preventive and risk determinants in health.8

        With vast amount of data as well as the computing capability of government
institutions, the emerging field of data science is revealing patterns that statistics does not
sufficiently convey.9, 10, 11 The linear measurement from multilevel regression discerns a certain
type of insight. Non-linear measurement from the sciences of complexity adds another
understanding of the interaction of stakeholders which contributes to the emergent, system-
level patterns in the distribution of environmental hazards. The Santa Fe Institute and
behavioral economists have developed a copus of knowledge in this area.12

 Part IV, Section A
Promoting climate adaptation and resilience and greenhouse gas reduction co-benefits will be an
important part of the EJ 2020 Action Agenda

Finance. For communities with willing property owners and renters as well as businesses, there
are ways to adapt financial products to assist environmental conservation and energy
sustainability. In states such as Ohio, which have legislatures influenced by special interests of
the carbon-based economy, e.g. Big Coal, a market-based approach may complement the
regulatory tools of any federal administration. With such overburdened communities, the
financing instruments can accelerate the adoption of green infrastructure and energy
sustainable infrastructure which improve public health 13; save costs to owners and the
municipality14; and increase housing value15. Credit enhancement helps with green
infrastructure and renewable energy projects, particularly in neighborhoods affected by sub-
prime predatory lending. The innovative deployment of Clean Water State Reserve Funds could
play a role with liability settlements between communities, states, and corporations. Given the
extent of contamination in some overburdened communities, a large loan fund or combination
of funding approaches may be necessary for remediation.

 Part IV, Section B
EPA will advance its program relative to the implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act through a
comprehensive, long-term Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Strategic Plan, which OCR is currently developing

Enforcement. Sometimes the lack of political commitment can impede the efforts of a
community to mitigate an environmental justice gap. National level data and the precedent of
cases can move regulatory and private actors to participate. The Office of Civil Rights can assist
organized communities with determining if their local regulatory institutions are performing
the role of enforcing accountability, liability, and social responsibility of banks, companies, and
municipalities. For instance, according to the Ohio Revised Code, the supervisors of the county-
level conservation districts, which are considered political subdivisions in Ohio, have powers
which include the ability “[t]o sue and plead in the name of the district, and be sued and
impleaded in the name of the district, with respect to its contracts and, as indicated in section
1515.081 of the Revised Code, certain torts of its officers, employees, or agents acting within the
scope of their employment or official responsibilities, or with respect to the enforcement of its
obligations and covenants made under this chapter …”16

Disclosure. Recently, in places such as the County of St. Louis in Missouri, there are revelations
that the radiological remnants of special nuclear material persist. To the extent possible, the
source of contamination in communities may be illuminated from further declassification of
records from and another comprehensive accounting of the production of resources for the
country’s weaponized atomic arsenal and peaceful atomic energy.

               Re:     Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework

      Dear Mr. Lee:

              The Texas Pipeline Association (""TPA"") submits the following comments on EPA's
      Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework (""EJ 2020""). TPA is an organization composed of 50
      members who gather, process, treat, and transport natural gas and hazardous liquids materials
      through intrastate pipelines in Texas. TPA's members will be affected by efforts outlined in the
      draft framework because our members engage in activities that could be affected by federal
      environmental justice initiatives.

               1.      Introduction.

              EPA seeks input on EJ 2020, which according to EPA will help advance environmental
      justice efforts in environmentally overburdened, underserved, and economically distressed
      communities. As stated in the following comments, TPA believes that the draft EJ 2020
      framework should be revised so that the agency's statement of its future environmental justice
      efforts is clear, the applicability of such efforts is easily understood, and those efforts do not
      impose undue burdens on the regulated community.

               2.      EPA should clarify its definition of ""overburdened communities.""

             A central focus of EPA's environmental justice efforts is to address and alleviate impacts
      on ""overburdened communities."" For example, EPA states that the goals of EJ 2020 are to
      ""deepen"" an environmental justice practice within EPA programs to improve the health and
      environment of overburdened communities1; collaborate with partners to expand EPA's impact

      1 EJ 2020 Framework at I.

                                             604 West 14th Street, Austin, Texas 78701

      EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            345
 within overburdened communities; and demonstrate progress on outcomes that matter to
overburdened communities.

        The term ""overburdened community,"" is key to the applicability of these future efforts.
Accordingly, we would urge EPA give grave consideration as to how this term is defined and to
provide clarification, as necessary. EPA has defined an ""overburdened community"" as one that
potentially experiences disproportionate environmental harms and risks as a result of cumulative
impacts or greater vulnerability to environmental hazards2; alternatively, EPA has used the term
to describe ""the minority, low-income, tribal, and indigenous populations or communities in the
United States that potentially experience disproportionate environmental harms and risks as a
result of greater vulnerability to environmental hazards.""3

        If these definitions are to be used with regard to EPA's EJ 2020 efforts, we urge EPA to
consider adding additional criteria so that the general public and the regulated community have a
better understanding of when future environmental justice initiatives might be employed. In
determining whether a community should be considered as being subject to the EJ 2020 efforts,
TPA urges EPA to consider inclusion of such factors as whether a substantial percentage of the
population of the affected community has an annual income that is less than the poverty
threshold or whether a substantial percentage of the population of the affected community is part
of a minority group. In addition, in all cases EPA should consider whether the community is
actually disproportionately impacted by industrial development, regardless of whether it is an
economically disadvantaged area. A community that is not disproportionately burdened by the
effects of industrial development is not an ""overburdened community,"" regardless of the socio-
economic status of its population.

         3.       TPA supports voluntary efforts to increase community awareness and
                  involvement.

        Part of the EJ 2020 effort is focused on enhancing public participation in the permitting
process and enhancing communication with low socio-economic (which are often majority
minority) communities affected by industrial activities.4 TPA supports voluntary efforts aimed
at increasing public understanding of, and participation in, the permitting process as well as
efforts aimed at increasing communication between industry and local affected communities.
Indeed, TPA has been at the forefront of initiatives aimed at opening the lines of communication
between industry and local communities. For example, TPA worked in concert with elected
officials and community leaders to improve communications between the pipeline industry and
local governments in the Barnett Shale area of Texas. The result of this collaborative effort was
a document titled Best Practices for Pipeline and Municipality Relations, which addresses issues
such as public participation in pipeline routing, use of public rights-of-way, and steps aimed at
creating enhanced communication between industry and affected communities.

          TPA's efforts in the Barnett Shale area are an example of the proactive and voluntary
initiatives that industry is already undertaking to foster better communication and to engage local
communities. To the extent that EPA's environmental justice efforts encourage additional
initiatives that can be undertaken on a voluntary basis, TPA supports those efforts. Industry has
demonstrated a wiliness and capacity to engage in voluntary efforts to engage local communities
and keep them informed of local development activities. This being so, there is no reason for
EPA to development mandatory regulatory requirements to increase community awareness of,
and involvement in, new permitting and development activities by industrial sources.

         4.       EPA should not assume that environmental justice efforts are needed simply
                  because a certain type of permit is being applied for.

         The draft EJ 2020 framework states that EPA intends to ""build[] environmental justice
into EPA permitting.""5 While EPA does not provide examples of the kinds of permits that might
be subject to future EPA environmental justice efforts, EPA in the past has indicated that
construction permits under the Clean Air Act (GAA), underground injection permits under the
Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and certain permits under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) may have significant public health or
environmental impacts, such that they might be a proper focus of agency environmental justice
efforts.6

        Assuming that EPA continues to view such permits as warranting particular focus in the
environmental justice context, TPA would note that current requirements already mandate
stringent pollution controls for the issuance of permits under those statutory programs.7 Current
regulations also require broad public participation during the application process for permits
issued under these programs. This being so, it would not be accurate to assume that enhanced
public participation, or other environmental justice efforts, are warranted every time an
application is made for one of these permits.

       In determining which permit applications are worthy of enhanced public participation or
other environmental justice efforts, EPA should not begin the analysis by focusing on the kind of
permit that is being applied for. Rather, EPA should first identify the location of any
overburdened communities in relation to the proposed facility or project, the
upstream/downstream or upwind/downwind impacts of the facility on individuals in the
community at issue, the magnitude of the impact on those individuals, and similar factors to
determine whether enhanced public participation is warranted. Only then would it be appropriate

movement of fluid into underground sources of drinking water, requirement of proper operation and
maintenance, duty to provide information, and monitoring and recordkeeping requirements (SDWA);
requirements establishing effluent limitations, monitoring and reporting obligations, upset and bypass
provisions, and use of best available technology economically achievable, or best conventional pollutant
control technology (CWA); and cradle-to-grave controls, including minimum technology requirements,
groundwater monitoring, air emission controls, and corrective action requirements (RCRA)).


EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                            347
 for EPA to assess the specific nature of anticipated impact from the issuance of the permit on the
nearby community and whether the community would benefit from environmental justice efforts,
such as enhanced public participation. Simply put, we urge EPA to refrain from concluding that
environmental justice efforts are appropriate based solely on the type of permit being requested.

         5.       Siting decisions in the natural gas industry are generally based on the
                  location of natural resources, and as such are outside of the industrial
                  development trends that environmental justice initiatives target.

        Environmental justice initiatives have traditionally sought to address perceived inequities
that can be caused by a company's decision to locate industrial facilities in low-income areas,
where real estate prices tend to be relatively low. In the natural gas industry, however, siting
decisions are not entirely driven by real estate prices; rather, these decisions are driven by the
location of the natural resource and the pathway to the marketplace. EPA should bear these
considerations in mind when it is developing methods to address environmental justice concerns.
Even if the facility is located in an overburdened community, TPA would urge EPA to take into
account whether or not siting of the facility is driven by factors other than simply the price of
real estate, such as the location of the natural resource.

         6.       Conclusion.

         The clarifications discussed above are necessary in order to ensure that the public and the
regulated community have a clear understanding of the scope of EPA's environmental justice
efforts. Those efforts should not include the development and implementation of additional
mandatory regulations where voluntary guidance would provide the greater flexibility necessary
to address the needs of all stakeholders in a variety of situations. EPA should also make clear
that any strategies that result from the current EJ 2020 effort will be entirely voluntary. The
federal rules that are already in place are more than sufficient to ensure environmental protection
for all citizens, and there is no need for additional regulatory requirements.

Subject:                         Comments on Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework


To: Charles Lee, Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice, US EPA

Dear Charles:

Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. I offer these
comments as a long-time scholar of environmental justice and as someone who has been deeply involved in various
environmental justice projects, planning, and advocacy throughout the U.S. for the past 25 or more years. However,
these comments reflect solely my own personal viewpoints and do not necessarily reflect the position of the University of
Louisville or any other entity with which I am affiliated.

The Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework is an exciting first step towards taking federal environmental justice policies
and principles to the next level of development and implementation. As a framework, it is fairly broad and general. I
would like to suggest some additional ideas and approaches that are fully consistent with those that are expressed in the
draft framework but that could either deepen the framework or be used to implement the framework's general elements.

There is an urgency to facilitate resilience in historically marginalized communities, which are especially vulnerable to a
variety of social-ecological-institutional changes and disturbances, such as drought, floods, storms, sea-level rise,
overstressed or polluted water sources, environmental effects on health, land use and population changes, changing
vegetation and species patterns (including pest and disease migration), urban heat island effects, wildfires, declining
forests and tree cover, pollution, economic shocks, local-government fiscal crises, and the like.

An environmental justice strategy focused on community resilience and adaptive capacity does not aim just to strengthen
communities so that they can resist changes (resistance concepts of resilience) or to increase their capacity to bounce
back from disasters (bounce-back concepts of resilience). Instead, the strategies should aim to increase communities'
adaptive capacity to navigate transitions in linked social, ecological, and institutional systems and to use inevitable
disturbances and changes as opportunities for community transformation (social-ecological concepts of
resilience). Resilient communities are the ones that have resources for change, flexibility or adaptability, strong social
capital (e.g. cooperation, trust, collaborative innovation), well-functioning ecosystems, and mechanisms for both
participation in environmental governance and social learning. In order to facilitate resilience in historically marginalized
or vulnerable communities, I would urge several strategies:

First, develop and use resilience assessments or community vulnerability assessments in planning and program
design. These assessments should include but not be limited to vulnerability to disasters. Community resilience is much
broader than disaster resistance or bounce-back. Moreover, I would encourage the development and increased us of
community-resilience self-assessment tools that allow marginalized or vulnerable communities to engage in their own
assessments. There are a number of tools available and new ones are currently being developed to facilitate resilience
assessments in a variety of different ways (i.e., appropriate to different needs, goals, and conditions) and at varying
levels of scope and detail. The EPA can assist in improving access to these tools and helping to facilitate design or
modification of tools to make them easier to use.

Second, invest in ecosystem services that benefit low-income, minority, Native American, disabled, elderly, young, and
other historically vulnerable and/or marginalized groups. Ecosystem services -- the beneficial and valuable functions that
natural ecological systems, such as wetlands, forests, and watersheds, provide to society and communities -- are critical
to the health and functioning of our communities. All too often, our historically marginalized groups and communities are
not just overburdened by harms but also under-benefitted by infrastructure (including green infrastructure) and nature's
services, which are necessary to their health and well-being. Thus, federal policies and programs should evaluate the
distribution of ecosystem services, the access of vulnerable or marginalized groups to these services, and the participation
of those groups in environmental, natural resources, and land use governance affecting ecosystem services.


                                                              1
            EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                               349
 Third, support and facilitate the incorporation of environmental-justice principles and resilience strategies into land use
decision making, because land use is a major driver of change in complex and interlinked ecological, social, and
institutional systems. Land use patterns and decisions affect local community resilience and adaptive
capacity. Watersheds can be effective and valuable scales at which to engage in planning and multi-stakeholder
collaboration (including inter-governmental collaboration) in ways that link ecosystem services, environmental justice,
community resilience, and land-use policies with one another. The federal government can influence local land use
planning, regulation, and decision making by mandating actions, stimulating changes, facilitating progress, or partnering
to collaborate with localities and other stakeholders. The first two methods are controversial, given strong cultural
preferences in the US for local control of land use decisions and relatively strong private property rights. However, in my
opinion, the federal government could do more to facilitate incorporation of environmental justice into local land use
decision making and to partner with localities, marginalized communities, and many other stakeholders to improve land
use decisions, despite the many different and beneficial ways that the EPA and other federal agencies engage in
facilitation and partnership activities. In general, polycentric systems are more resilient and adaptive than monocentric
systems. Strong federal control over land use would likely put historically vulnerable communities at greater risk, not
lesser risk, of harm from any failed policies or uniform programs ill-matched to local conditions and needs. However,
facilitating polycentric action or partnering with many different stakeholders and governance institutions could help
considerably, while also being well-received politically and socially.

Fourth, develop multiple-method (or multi-modal) design of participatory processes that provide many different ways for
historically marginalized groups to participate meaningfully and effectively in environmental, natural resources, and land
use decision making or governance. Research on participatory preferences and the fit of participatory processes to
participant needs shows that people prefer many different types and means of participation in planning and program
design, implementation, and enforcement, and that there is no ""one-size-fits-all."" Moreover, most governance processes
are iterative, with many different decisions being made and remade over time. One-time opportunities to participate
formally (e.g., in hearings) are not adequate to ensure full and meaningful participation in how environmental and
resource decisions actually get made. Moreover, the use of formal legal processes can facilitate informal collaborative
processes. For example, in some cases, litigation escalates conflict and fails to solve environmental problems fairly, but in
other cases, litigation can stimulate opportunities for under-represented groups to participate in governance and better
multi-participant collaborative problem-solving in the long run. Participatory processes should be assessed against the
preferences of participants and people who would like to participate, and should be assessed for diversity of methods
over time.

Fifth, use adaptive planning processes for governance where planning is desired or legally mandated. Although scientists
and resource managers often prefer adaptive management processes for complex management of ecosystems and
related natural resources, there is a misperception that the kind of flexibility and experimental learning that characterize
adaptive management are inconsistent with planning. However, planning is often necessary for public goal-setting,
compliance with legal requirements, and incorporation of environmental-justice principles into decisions. Fortunately,
there is a well-developed theory and practice of adaptive planning, which integrates adaptation to changing conditions
into planning processes. In fact, I will be teaching an online, six-week, asynchronous professional-development course in
Adaptive Planning and Resilience through the University of Louisville, beginning in October 2015. This course is being
developed in order to meet a need for both environmental/natural-resources/land-use governance professionals and
leaders/members of historically marginalized communities to develop knowledge and skills in adaptive planning. As new
conditions, disasters, and disturbances affect communities and institutions, plans must be flexible enough to adapt. An
environmental-justice strategy would focus on enhancing the planning capacity of vulnerable communities.

Sixth, all federal, state, and local governance processes for the environment, natural resources, and land use should
include feedback loops that enable learning and adaptation. Feedback loops involve continual monitoring of management
actions and plan implementation, assessment or analysis of monitoring data, identification of key lessons learned, and
changes to (adaptation of) plans, policies, programs, and management activities to incorporate the lessons
learned. Learning includes both expert learning (e.g., scientific learning) and public learning (e.g., social learning). An
environmental-justice strategy requires feedback loops that evaluate effects of environmental, natural resources, and land
use decisions and actions on marginalized or vulnerable groups. However, it also requires involving these groups in
monitoring, assessment, learning, and adaptation. Diverse participation in feedback loop processes is
essential. Moreover, we need methods and tools by which these groups and communities can develop their own
feedback loops and communicate the information to various decision making entities.

76_Union CS comments on EJ2020 framework July 14 2015.pdf,"        July 14, 2015

        Dr. Charles Lee
        Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice
        USEPA, Office of Environmental Justice (2201-A)
        1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460


        Dear Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice Lee,

        On behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientist’s 450,000 members and supporters,
        we are writing in support of the EPA’s efforts to advance environmental justice
        through its programs, policies and activities in accordance with Title VI of the Civil
        Rights Act of 1964. We strongly believe that environmental sustainability and
        environmental justice can and must go hand-in-hand, and that over the long term one
        cannot be achieved without the other. We welcome the opportunity to provide input
        on the draft EJ2020 Action Agenda framework and would like to highlight
        opportunities to strengthen the framework.

        UCS recommendations:

             1. To ensure a more robust incorporation of environmental justice considerations
                in EPA policies, they must be made a key required component from the
                beginning of a rulemaking process or permitting action and not just a
                possibility, afterthought or late-stage add-on. The complexity and importance
                of EJ issues cannot be adequately addressed without devoting sufficient time,
                attention and resources to them throughout the rule-making process.

             2. Environmental Justice analyses of major new rules must be made mandatory,
                and done as part of, or alongside, the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) as part
                of the proposed rule. If there is an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
                the agency should explicitly solicit comments on how to incorporate EJ
                concerns in the proposed rule. Simply using a traditional cost-benefit analysis
                to evaluate the impact of a rule does not appropriately account for significant
                impacts on certain communities that may not be easily monetized or may be
                undervalued. We welcome the EPA’s Guidance on Considering
                Environmental Justice During the Development of Regulatory Actions and



EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           352
                  look forward to the finalization of the companion Draft Technical Guidance
                 for Assessing EJ in Regulatory Analysis (EJTG) in 2015. We support many of
                 the recommendations made by the Scientific Advisory Board in April 2015 to
                 strengthen the EJTG.1 In particular, we reiterate the need to: provide clear,
                 specific options, and examples of best practices for EJ analyses; tighten the
                 EJTG to convey a stronger commitment to the requirement for EJ analysis
                 instead of erring on the side of flexibility; and develop guidance on how to
                 incorporate and evaluate cumulative impacts.

             3. If a rule has already been proposed at the time that this framework is
                finalized, the EJ analysis should either be done for the final rule or required as
                part of the state implementation process. The EPA should extend to states the
                requirement to take into account EJ considerations in their state
                implementation plans, and provide clear guidance on how to do so.

             4. The Agency must provide clear, actionable guidance for mandatory
                implementation and reporting requirements for EJ analyses for all major
                agency actions, else there is a risk that environmental justice will continue to
                be treated as an optional consideration rather than an integrated component of
                rulemaking and permitting. Agency staff and programs should be held
                accountable for meeting these mandatory requirements. The draft framework
                does not provide enough specific guidance for actions that must happen, and
                instead leaves a lot of room for interpretation and much flexibility for
                implementation.

             5. The EPA should provide more guidance on which of the existing, or newly
                developed tools, trainings, and resources are most appropriate for conducting
                EJ analyses in specific scenarios, as well as offer advice on follow-up
                monitoring and reporting to assess progress toward achieving identified goals.
                The recently released Environmental Justice and Mapping Tool (EJSCREEN),
                and the California Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental health
                screening tool, CalEnviroScreen, C-FESRT and T-FESRT, are good examples
                that should be replicated and used nationwide. The new EJSCREEN tool is a
                step in the right direction but needs further development and strengthening,
                for example, enabling users to compare data across locations and over a
                period of time so that progress on EJ efforts can be tracked. Every effort
                should be made to ensure that data underlying this tool stays up-to-date, is

                  user friendly and accessible, and that users understand the utility and
                 limitations of the tool.

             6. EJ analyses and tools must take into account the cumulative burden of
                multiples stressors faced by EJ communities. Communities of color in the
                U.S. disproportionately reside in neighborhoods with higher cancer risk from
                toxic air contaminants,2 higher exposure to traffic-related criteria air
                pollutants,3 and more environmentally hazardous sites.4 This unequal
                distribution of exposures appears to contribute at least in part to health
                disparities between racial and ethnic groups in environmentally-sensitive
                diseases such as cancer and asthma.5 It is particularly important to evaluate
                the cumulative impacts of multiple environmental stressors, rather than look
                narrowly at the single, latest one being considered, and also to evaluate them
                in the context of socioeconomic stressors that make communities more
                vulnerable.6

             7. An EJ screening tool must routinely be applied to all EPA rulemaking,
                policies and actions, including permitting actions such as permits for siting
                toxic landfills as well as for monitoring, compliance and enforcement. We
                look forward to the finalization and implementation of guidelines for EJ
                analysis for EPA permits as soon as possible.

             8. The implementation of the EPA’s EJ action agenda must be outcome-
                oriented, and accompanied by clear markers of progress and metrics of
                success. The metrics should be developed in collaboration with EJ partners so
                as to ensure that their priorities are represented and closely tracked. In this
                regard, we support the outcomes-oriented approach requested in the

             9. The EPA must engage proactively and in an ongoing way, including during
                the rulemaking process, with stakeholders from the environmental justice
                community, including holding action-oriented community listening sessions
                and workshops in locations e.g., in urban settings that are relevant and
                accessible for the EJ community, building capacity, sharing tools and know-
                how, and taking proactive steps to incorporate feedback from stakeholders.
                Disadvantaged communities may not have the resources to engage alongside
                larger organizations or well-funded industry interests but it is incumbent on
                the EPA to seek out and elevate their perspective.

             10. The Agency should make a long term commitment to training its staff and
                 dedicating resources to implementing its EJ action agenda across the breadth
                 of Agency actions, particularly related to significant statutes like the Clean
                 Air Act and Clean Water Act. The Agency should highlight to the
                 Administration and Congress the importance of dedicated funding to fulfill
                 these goals, along with attendant staffing needs to continually update EJ tools,
                 engage with stakeholders, deploy resources, train users, and undertake
                 capacity building in communities, as requested.

    The Honorable Regina McCarthy
    Administrator
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    1200 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.
    Washington, DC 20460

    RE: Environmental Justice 2020

    Dear Administrator McCarthy:

            I applaud the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to ""environmental
    justice"" and for crafting the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda (EJ 2020) framework. In response to the
    release of the draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda and request for comments, I convened meetings with elected
    and community leaders from my district to solicit their input. A list of the outstanding and
    knowledgeable Hillsborough County and Pinellas County leaders who participated is provided below. I
    have summarized our comments and concerns and EPA's initiatives and policies, including support for a
    cross-agency strategy to benefit economically-distressed communities.

    Enhance Grants to Local Communities for Job Training & Education - When granting funds and
    assistance to communities to reduce or eliminate pollution, the EPA should focus on training, educating
    and employing people in the affected communities to do the work, including local small businesses.
    Environmental workforce development and job training grants could employ individuals in the affected
    areas in the fields of hazardous and solid waste management, assessment, and cleanup associated
    activities, chemical safety, emergency response, integrated pest management, and waste and stormwater
    management. When conducting Brownfields and Superfund redevelopment, job training and
    employment for individuals in the affected disadvantaged communities would put people and places
    back to work and create more sustainable communities. Training folks in environmental services, health
    and safety would also ensure a steady supply of labor for future oil or coal ash spills and the resulting
    restoration activities.

    Furthermore, reducing air pollution from power plants through energy conservation and renewable
    energy could create thousands of local jobs. Energy conservation focuses on making buildings and
    homes more energy efficient and these investments require a broad range of expertise in different
    industries. Energy conservation will increase demand for electricians, heating/air-conditioning installers,
    carpenters, construction equipment operators, roofers, insulation workers, industrial truck drivers,



           EJ 2020 Public Comments                 PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER                                356
 construction managers and building inspectors. More solar energy would increase demand for
installation professionals, manufacturing, sales and distribution and project developers. We
respectfully urge you to focus environmental justice, education, job training and other environmental
remediation grants in low income communities and to provide job training and jobs to individuals in
those communities. We also request that the EPA consider leveraging its resources with Community
Redevelopment Areas where possible. Further, we suggest that the EPA consider making grants
available directly to local governments and non-profits agencies in addition or in lieu of recalcitrant state
governments.

Expand Brownfields- There are over 378 Brownfield sites in the state and of Florida's 50 highest
hazard-ranked Superfund sites, Hillsborough County has the two highest-ranked sites and Pinellas
County has one site. Incorporating Brownfield redevelopment into environmental justice initiatives and
prioritizing redevelopment in low income communities, as well as providing job-training, education and
employment to the people in these targeted areas, would help to both stem the issue of poverty and
create lasting, positive economic improvements in the areas surrounding Brownfield sites. Success in
developing these sites can already been seen in both Hillsborough County and Pinellas County, with
redevelopment being strategically used to attract investors and, in turn, jobs to impoverished areas.

For example, when the accreditation of the Old Mercy Hospital, located in a minority populated section
of St. Petersburg, was in jeopardy due to a perception of environmental contamination with the site, the
City of St. Petersburg and the EPA stepped in to renovate and upgrade the building. The project not only
created 80 jobs, but it saved the existing jobs from the hospital and the surrounding jobs it supports. In
Tampa, we have a great example of the growing ""Healthfields"" movement, improving access to health
and healthcare through Brownfield redevelopment.The Tampa Family Health Center in East Tampa
provides services to 16,500 patients a year in a severely underserved area. We need to invest much more
in Brownfield redevelopment, especially in the creation of health care facilities, recreational
opportunities, housing and access to healthy food in places where these resources are scarce. Robust
support for Brownfield redevelopment will clean up sites, create jobs and improve health.

Strengthen Clean Air Monitoring - Estimated lifetime cancer risks from hazardous air pollutants in
Florida are highest for Latinos and African Americans, especially those in the lower income categories.
In Hillsborough County, low income families are numerically worse off than the rest of the population
in the county for one or more of the following environmental burdens: cancer risks from hazardous air
pollutants, releases of toxic chemicals, superfund sites, facilities emitting smog and particulates. With
an increase in residential development near industrial areas in both Hillsborough County and Pinellas
County, increased monitoring of utility and other industrial sulfur dioxide emissions to ensure
compliance with standards are necessary, particularly in light of potential S02 related health issues.

Increase Drinking Water and Clean Water Revolving Loans — Traditionally underserved communities
have historically lacked infrastructure modernization. Many of them have old water pipes that may
contain lead, which can damage the central nervous system and impact a child's learning abilities.
Increasing investments in Drinking and Clean Water State Revolving Funds in low income



    EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                           357
 communities, especially those with a history of contamination, would aid in further planning, designing,
and constructing water pollution control facilities to counteract water quality issues experienced within
those communities.

Combine Clean Power Plan with carbon reduction strategies and energy efficiency - In 2013, total
greenhouse gas emissions were the equivalent of over 128 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which
contributes to climate change. While work reducing carbon production at the local level is advancing,
implementation of the Clean Power Plan in conjunction with local efforts will maximize potential
reduction of carbon emissions. This can be achieved by reducing carbon dioxide pollution from power
plants through energy efficiency and renewable energy and providing and prioritizing job-training and
employment in the associated occupations such as electricians, insulation workers, installers and
carpenters to individuals in low income communities. Furthermore, the EPA could assist local
governments in reducing carbon pollution by increasing the Diesel Retrofit grants, assistance in smart
growth planning and alternative modes of transportation.

Tamet Gulf of Mexico Restoration Initiatives — With billions of dollars expected to flow to the Gulf
Coast Restoration Trust Fund, per the historic RESTORE Act, a once-in-a —lifetime opportunity to
revitalize the Gulf of Mexico, states and local governments should consider restoration and economic
development projects in disadvantaged communities. EPA and its partner agencies should train
individuals in low income communities in cleanup associated activities and environmental restoration In
addition, the EPA should consider setting aside a portion of the work hours to be performed by
disadvantaged workers. The RESTORE Act calls for grants to be used for environmental restoration,
economic development, research, science, observation, monitoring and technology. We encourage EPA
and other RESTORE Act participants to keep in mind our neighbors in disadvantaged communities,
when proceeding with these initiatives.

Strengthen the Toxic Release Inventory - The economy of the State of Florida depends on a clean and
healthy environment and on a safe and healthy workforce and citizenry. While EPA and the State of
Florida have made progress over the past decade in reducing on-site toxic releases, there is great room
for improvement. As you know, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) tracks certain toxic chemicals from
industrial facilities that pose a threat to human health and the environment. Florida ranks 4 th in the
country with reported underground injection of TRI chemicals and 7th with reported releases of TRI
chemicals to the environment. However, TRI does not include many toxic chemicals nor does it include
other industries that release toxic chemicals.

        No child or family should suffer disproportionately because they do not have the means to move
to a neighborhood that is not polluted or their community traditionally did not have the power to fight
the siting of noxious or dangerous uses in their neighborhood. I trust that the EPA through the EJ 2020
Action Agenda, will continue to champion improvements to environmentally overburdened and
underserved communities. Too often, these communities have been abandoned by a lack of investment
and environmental protection, causing a dearth of job opportunities and health disparities. By educating,
training and hiring disadvantaged workers to clean up contaminated sites and develop them into health

 centers, parks, urban farms or housing, we can begin to address the underlying issues plaguing these
deprived communities. I look forward to working with you as you develop this important initiative. Our

Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator for Environmental Justice

Washington, DC 20460


Dear Deputy Associate Assistant Administrator Lee:

Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the EJ 2020 Framework document, which
builds on EPA’s Plan EJ 2014.

EPA is correct in claiming progress on environmental justice during the last several years. These are
worthy accomplishments.

                    EPA has completed guidance and policy documents related to several areas including
                     development of rules.
                    EPA has considered how to use enforcement tools and actions to reduce exposures in
                     highly impacted communities. Increased enforcement of existing statutes and rules is
                     probably the fastest way to achieve actual gains in environmental quality for impacted
                     communities. Such efforts should be continued and increased.
                    EPA has also allocated resources to assist with community projects of different types in
                     many areas. This reflects an understanding of the importance of place to health and the
                     need to work on community needs and priorities.
                    Finally, EPA has after many years released the EJ Screen tool.

At the same time, our understanding of the significance of the interaction of multiple environmental
factors and conditions along with both susceptibility of individuals and groups and vulnerability of
communities has only increased. Research studies and screening tools such as the Cal EnviroScreen
show co-occurrence of multiple adverse environmental factors and conditions, enhanced vulnerability,
as well as the lack of positive environmental attributes such as parks, open space, and even food stores
in highly impacted communities. This demands a focused and integrated response from US EPA.

While the EJ2020 document has many positive themes, it does not seem to provide a strategy worthy of
the challenge. It identifies topics and areas in very general ways and does not indicate how EPA will



        EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                                                 361
 move forward on issues that have been difficult for it to address in the past. There do not seem to be any
conceptual or practical breakthroughs reflected in this document. Five areas of particular concern are
noted here.

1. Systematic approaches are overdue –

       Addressing environmental justice requires systematic approaches that allow the agency and the
       public to ascertain how much of the problem has been identified, how much has been addressed,
       and what is left to be done.

       One important step would be the development and implementation of metrics that can allow the
       agency and the public to see where we stand, where progress has been achieved, and where it has
       not. EPA recognizes the significance of metrics with its clean air policies, for example, and
       produces documents and information sources that demonstrate the status of air quality,
       improvements that have been made, and the challenges that remain. This allows us to see where
       we stand and what results have been achieved from resources invested.

       The new strategy does not seem to be offering any significant gains in developing a systematic
       approach to assessing, documenting, tracking, and addressing environmental justice issues. This
       is needed at this time and is feasible to do.

2. It’s more than one rule –

       The 2020 framework retains an emphasis on addressing environmental justice in each of the rule-
       making processes run by the agency. This is certainly important as far as it goes. However, as
       we know very well, one of the essential elements of environmental justice is to address the
       cumulative burden that falls on communities. This comes from a combination of all of the
       environmental factors and conditions, along with the susceptibilities and vulnerabilities of a
       community and its people. The agency does not seem to have advanced in its thinking about
       how to do this.

       We need strategies that address multiple pollutants and outcomes rather than simply tinker
       with the rule for each pollutant one at a time.

3. We can work for multiple results or benefits –

       Environmental health and quality policies in the time of sustainability are evolving toward
       actions that can improve multiple parameters. For example, emphasizing active transport
       strategies have multiple benefits that include reductions in combustion that improves air quality,
       reduction in greenhouse emissions, and positive benefits for health. Clean energy strategies that
       reduce use of combustion sources also have multiple benefits for the environment, health, and
       sustainability. Investment in such strategies in highly impacted communities can also bring
       greater economic resources to people who need them. Deeper consideration of broader multi-
       benefit strategies would bring significant gains to highly impacted communities.

4. EPA must update methods to match new science –




   EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                         362
        To address environmental justice through science related approaches, through a new research
       strategy for example, will require EPA to update even some long-used approaches to
       incorporate new science. This seems to be lagging at the agency in areas of rule making such as
       the rules for categories of air toxics.

5. Engagement with communities must continue to improve –

       Finally, while the document emphasizes engagement with communities, we still see too many
       examples where communities are put through the ringer to achieve an outcome that protects or
       improves public health. All too often the state and federal agencies let the more politically
       powerful entities call the shots, leaving the communities to do all of the heavy lifting to get
       sound remedies or results.

       EPA has made some improvements in this area, but greater attention to engaging with
       communities and working with them is needed and probably always will be. Metrics are
       important here as well so that EPA can better understand itself how much of the need for
       addressing environmental health and environmental justice issues in communities is being met.

In closing, I know that many dedicated people including you have worked tirelessly for many years to
better understand and address environmental justice in the face of an institution that is not particularly
responsive to these concerns. The fact that there is more to do does not dishonor the sincere efforts that
have been made by many people over many years.

Yet, the needs of the people demand more from the agency.

Thank you for your consideration of these comments. They reflect my views and not those of any
institution or funder.


                                                             Very truly yours,

Re: Comments on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework
Sent via: ejstrategy@epa.gov


Dear whom it may concern at the US Environmental Protection Agency:
On behalf of the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation, I am pleased to submit this comment letter
regarding the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework. This letter is a continuation of the
University of California, Los Angeles’ engagement with the US EPA around issues of
environmental justice (EJ).
The UCLA Luskin Center commends the EPA for a solid Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda
Framework that contains many critical components. We recognize that it well designed to build
upon Plan EJ 2014 and in general advance the progress that the agency has made since the
Executive Order 128989 on environmental justice.
During development of Plan EJ 2014―a time when EPA was ramping up efforts to
systematically incorporate EJ considerations into its core activities―UCLA received a grant
from EPA to collaboratively organize “Closing the Environmental Justice Gap: A Workshop on
Advancing Evaluation Methods.” This event held at UCLA in 2011 brought together
approximately 100 researchers and environmental justice leaders from across the nation to
develop the sub-field of EJ policy and program evaluation. The result of the workshop was the
report Pathways to Environmental Justice: Advancing a Framework for Evaluation. This
report/tool lays out a framework for regulators, grantees, researchers, and community members
interested in the effective design and implementation of EJ policies and programs. It built upon
existing EPA tools, such as the Guidelines for Evaluating an EPA Partnership Program, and
tailored these tools for an EJ context.
Now more than ever it is important to demonstrate EJ progress at both national and local levels.
Thus, we were heartened to see that the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework, Section III,
focuses on accountability, developing indicators of success, and measuring and demonstrating
outcomes. EJ 2020 should provide additional tools that EPA regional officers, grantees,
researchers, and community stakeholders can use for planning, evaluating, and adjusting EJ
programs and policies to ensure accountability and impact.
As such, we recommend that EPA leverage the report Pathways to Environmental Justice:
Advancing a Framework for Evaluation. It could be one of your foundational tools to help
stakeholders develop indicators of success and measure outcomes as part of a systematic

Karen,

Thanks for reminding me. The Draft 2020 Action Agenda Framework looks great. I’m particularly jazzed about the Items I.D.‐
Enhancing Science tools…and II.C – Support transformative efforts... These are very much needed and has come up in the NAS
GRP AB meetings. Because EJ crosses, so many technical areas and increasingly there is a body of information that goes
untapped regarding potential best practices, I would considering adding the following as a bullet:

               Develop methods targeted at capturing and synthesizing existing environmental, health and community impact data


Under item II.C., the last three bullets are very comprehensive, which is great. It does leave me wondering how? Will this be
achieved through internal policy or external grant funding opportunities to local NGOs and the like? I would considering
adding more prescriptive language, if possible, to those bullets. For example the second bullet could begin with ""Develop and
implement new funding opportunities to promote holistic strategies that meet communities”… Also, if possible it would be
great if a bullet similar to this was added:

               Establish a direct linkage through Request for Proposal language between existing EPA funded workforce
                development and job training programs and the various contracting opportunities, which fall under the purview of
                EPA.


From my perspective we won’t have environmental justice, until we have economic justice, which means more jobs
opportunities in effected communities.

Thanks again for reminding me to provide comments.

Pat

Subject:                         EPA comment on EJ strategies 2020


Hello:
As an Environmental Justice Stakeholder, I am writing to provide feedback on EPA Extended Public Comment
Period on the Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda.

I have concerns about ""meaningful involvement"" within the process. The strategy is just a strategy that is used
to a certain level and it falls off the radar.

I have attended many meetings and workshops, in which some where not EPA, but what I learned was that
""quality of life"" written in grant guidance is a buzzword that means, ""it does not include African-
Americans"". This comment did not come from EPA or their partners, but I have read it in EPA documents-
(quality of life) - This is disturbing. I do know of other buzzwords that cause me to be dismayed. I have been a
member of EPA listserve for over 15 years. I take all of the information from EPA to heart and work hard to
implement it. Through the EPA Brownfield Cleanup grant Cooperative agreement for the City of Howardville,
which speaks of local source hiring, prevailing wage, and apprenticeship to ""Ensure"" the affected population
would benefit, has been a struggle. I had to meet with the Attorney and new project officer, (not knowing that I
was in trouble).

TAB - Region 7 was pulled into the meeting because they failed to ""make me understand"". When I became
aware of what was going on, I advised my project officer and attorney that TAB did talk to me, put I was the
one pushing it and I passed the attorney a paper and stated, this is where I got it from.

It talked about a strategy ""Ensuring"" the benefit of the affected people, that was used in the Job Training grants,
but the strategy was upgraded to include ALL of EPA programs. ( source: EPA,2008)
We quickly got on the same page and everything was fine. I felt bad because I was in trouble and I didn't know
it. I explained to them that I would never do anything intentionally to hurt EPA or their programs, I love the
organization and what it stands for.

On a personal and confidential note: I think I have more experience and knowledge of EPA and their programs,
than some of the staff. (meaning some staff assigned to me, may not have been aboard in 2008, when that
strategy was implemented.
This include concerns about grant reviewers, who not only do not know the region, but express doubt that a
strategy that be accomplished, even when documentation was provided that it had been done before, and not
only that, but they proceeded to deduct points, which if anything, according to the guidelines, it should have
been a neutral score, and they made statements that were not true and deducted points for that. The rules for
grievances state, the grievance cannot be based on points. I think that rule is an ""embedded barrier"" and the
reviewer qualifications should be reviewed. Maybe I think too much, but I am giving an honest and heartfelt
opinion.

One last bit of confidential information, I often get questions, and questions about hearing from Althea. These
questions come from people from other Departments of EPA. Maybe that's a good thing, but it makes me feel
like I am being investigated. Whatever I do comes from EPA, I tell them that I have known Althea since 1998,
I saw and talked to her in 2005, 2008 and 2011. It has been 4 years. I would never do anything to hurt, harm or

                                                             1
            EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                      366
 compete at an unfair advantage to gain anything. Nor do I believe that Althea would do that and for the record,
it has never happened. I am a giver and helper of the Environment, doing it EPA way.

With that being said, my comments below regarding EJ 2020 Action Agenda should be viewed with the above
concerns in mind.

OF the 3 goals, number 1 is extremely important
1. ""Deepen Environmental Justice PRACTICE - I am starting to feel that some of the documents are just
""words on paper""

I feel the cooperative agreement that invokes EJ strategies should be honored. I also feel that problems,
involving implementation of EJ strategies causes delays in scheduling and put us way off course of our targeted
deadlines.

I believe in EPA and all of its programs, of which we can truly benefit if we are allowed to participate in a real
and true ""meaningful involvement"". I am a person who take words and put them into action, they grow legs and
walk off the paper. I like to see the outcomes of our efforts and goals. When we struggle with these issues, it
causes depression and make you reluctant to apply for additional grants.

I have been accepted (very competitive) to a Community Research cohort, to help us with data gaps when we
get ready to apply for a Federally Qualified Community Health Center, for the school. The class is in St. Louis,
every thursday, through graduation, August 20. So I will be leaving in route to St. Louis around 2:30. I don't
have to have a followup, I just want to make sure that I can tune in to EJ dialogue when the opportunity arise.

I am excited about the EJ meeting in Chicago, I plan on attending. I am not on the registration list right
now. The city had to send a check for my registration, but I should be on the attendee list shortly.
Ok, I gotta put on my productivity hat and get moving.

Be Blessed today and thank you for the opportunity to chime in.

                                 framework


Re: Public comment on the Environmental Protection Agency’s draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda framework.


Dear Office of Civil Rights:

The Washington State Department of Ecology appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the EPA’s draft EJ
2020 Action Agenda framework. Ecology has a longstanding commitment to environmental justice, and continues to
develop strategies and actions that support Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and advance environmental justice for
Washington communities.

I want to thank you for developing a comprehensive framework that provides insight into the EPA’s EJ next steps, and
serves as a practical model for those outside of the EPA to consider. As the Action Agenda advances, I am especially
interested in further dialogue and details on the following:

I. DEEPEN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PRACTICE WITHIN EPA PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT
OF OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES

• Ongoing efforts to share information on the EPA’s internal EJ integration processes are greatly appreciated. As a state
partner, opportunities to learn about the implementation successes and challenges are invaluable.
• Clarity about the opportunities and implications of the Action Agenda for state partners is anticipated (e.g., details on
“engagement with states” when building EJ into EPA permitting).
• Clarification and development of a standardized method on how to “consider impacts on overburdened communities.”

II. COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS TO EXPAND OUR IMPACT WITHIN COMMUNITIES

• Continued and varied forms of knowledge dissemination to government partners and the public: The EPA’s EJ Analysis
Seminar Series is an excellent example of both improving transparency and broadening participation in a progressive EJ
conversation. As a state agency EJ staff of one, I rely on communication, tools, and resources from my EPA Region 10 EJ
colleagues. Insight into federal EJ work supports and advances local efforts. Possible topics to explore are training on
NEPA EJ analysis, exploration of EJSCREEN and CDC’s Tracking Network, other federal agency EJ steps and innovations.
• Increase opportunities to leverage resources and build community networks on national EJ challenges (e.g. CAFOs).

III. DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS ON OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO COMMUNITIES

• Development of national metrics to demonstrate EJ and health equity progress. Federal movement to institute
accountability will serve as a model for local and state decision‐makers.

VI. RELATED EFFORTS

• We anticipate the publication of the long‐term Office of Civil Rights Strategic Plan. Title VI compliance raises
challenging questions on how recipients of federal financial assistance can implement actions to meet Title VI
requirements and how compliance is determined. Ecology encourages and anticipates clarification, guidance, training,
and capacity building from the EPA that will support meeting this federal requirement.

                                                               1

COMMENTS and RECOMMENDATIONS

RE: DRAFT EPA EJ-2015 to 2020 Framework

It positive to see that the new Environmental Justice Framework has reach President
Obama’s Cabinet level support. In August 2011, President Barack Obama approved the
Environmental Justice Memorandum of Understating (MOU) with the secretaries of 18
branches of the federal government signing this historic MOU.

The following areas of national concern were quoted in the President Obama’s EJ MOU
August 2011:

        (1) implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA);
        (2) implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;
        (3) impacts from climate change; and
        (4) impacts from commercial transportation and supporting infrastructure (“goods
        movement”).

        These efforts will include interagency collaboration. At least every three (3)
        years, the Interagency Working Group will, based in part on public
        recommendations identified in Annual Implementation Progress Reports, identify
        important areas for Federal agencies to consider and address, as appropriate, in
        environmental justice strategies, annual implementation progress reports and
        other efforts.

    A. Since August 2011, many dedicated and long suffering community and tribal
       leaders, and their collaborating legal and research partners, have pushed for
       stronger implementation of environmental justice in NEPA as its relates to
       Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) that support permitting for land use,
       zoning, and site construction of government and industrial facilities that distribute
       and/or emit air/water/soil pollutants. Recommendation: Include and address
       this glaring omission in the EJ-2020 Framework to strengthen
       implementation of environmental justice in NEPA as its relates to
       Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) that support permitting for land
       use, zoning, and site construction of government and industrial facilities
       that distribute and/or emit air/water/soil pollutants.




                                              1

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                   370
     B. Since, August 2011, the Title VI Alliance for Accountability and Transparency
       (collaborative of EJ community leaders, attorneys, researchers, and more) has
       pushed for a “real” response to Title VI compliance to the EPA’s Office of Civil
       Rights. It still appears that EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice is several steps
       ahead of EPA’s Office of Civil Rights in addressing Title VI complaints filed by
       and on behalf of environmental justice communities and tribal areas that have
       long overdue in redress and corrective action at the federal, regional, and state
       levels. Recommendation: The reference of Title VI in the Draft EJ-2020
       Framework must include more than just “words”. Include measurable
       outcomes at the federal, regional, and state level on “Interagency and
       Intergovernmental Solutions” basis. Move Interagency Working Group
       (IWG) activities from “listening sessions” to “solutions workshops” with
       federal and state agencies at various level of government providing the
       necessary resources and corrective actions measured at the community
       and tribal levels.

    C. April 2015, it was great to hear President Barack Obama push climate change
       issues as infrastructure and public health concerns on national and international
       news. Recommendation: Include in the EJ-2020 Framework President
       Obama’s commitment to have press conferences that the push for
       compliance and enforcement of civil rights, public health, and
       environmental laws that support compliance and enforcement for
       environmental justice. A specific would be sanctions on states’ funding
       when there is not full compliance, enforcement, and transparency before or
       after releasing billions in federal taxpayers’ money to “recipients”.

    D. Presidents Obama’s 2011 EJ Memorandum of Understanding highlights “goods
       movement” (impacts from commercial transportation and supporting
       infrastructure). Yet, there is not one single mention of Goods Movement in the
       Draft EJ-2020 Framework! I, Omega Wilson, was one the community
       perspective members of EPA National Environmental Justice Advisory Council
       (NEJAC) that worked on Goods Movement Recommendations from 2007 to
       2010. Recommendation: In respect for President Barack Obama’
       Environmental Justice Memorandum of Understanding – August-2011 and
       the 18 federal branch secretaries who signed on, include in the EJ-2020
       Framework a timeline and interagency appropriations for implementation
       and enforcement of the EPA NEJAC Goods Movement Recommendations –
       2009. Include regional and state staffing with operating guidelines for
       compliance and responses to local complaints.

    E. The EPA EJ 2020-Framework is missing so many of the necessary structural
       components that support the long-term protection and corrections related to air,
       water, and soil quality that improve quality of life. The national and international
       growth model has to address risky and hazardous ways economies and
       populations grow. Recommendation: Include in the EPA EJ 2020-Framework
       language and strategies that address impacts that EPA’s National

                                             2

EJ 2020 Public Comments                                                                  371
         Environmental Justice Advisory Council(s) have worked on for two
        decades:
           1) Goods Movement (air, marine, rail, and highway corridors),
           2) Agribusiness (confined animal feeding operations, pesticides, land /
              watershed / wetland preservation, and water resources),
           3) Energy (coal mining industry, coal ash, hydraulic fracking)
           4) Solid Waste (landfills, recycling, ground water contamination)

It is regrettable and un-excusable for millions of dollars and thousands of paid and
volunteer human hours to have been invested on EPA NEJAC recommendations and
they are subsequently still being disregarded in the present and for future years.

I trust that these renewed recommendations find their way in the new EJ 2020-
Framework.

      April 15, 1889, Asa Philip Randolph was born. Randolph received numerous awards for
    decades of leadership in the civil rights, labor rights, and poltical rights movements. His
    contributions to what we call “goods movement” was documented as early as 1919 with the
    organization of African-American shipyard and dock workers at rail and marine ports and
    that connected to expanding highway corridors. One of Randolph’s greatest railroad
    successes came in 1925 when he was elected a President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping
    Car Porters. In his senior years, Asa Philip Randolph was one of the close confidents,
    mentors, and strategists for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s efforts that resulted in the March
    on Washington of August 28, 1963, Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Voting Right Act of 1965.
    Amtrak named one of their best sleeping cars, Superliner II Deluxe Sleeper 32503, the ""A.

Subject:                         Comments regarding the DRAFT EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework


To The Environmental Justice Work Group at EPA re: the Framework for the EJ 2020 Action Agenda:

As the EPA structures the Framework for its EJ 2020 Action Agenda as the EPA’s next overarching strategic plan for
environmental justice and I would strenuously recommend that there is an urgent need for EPA to review its present
policies concerning the imminent health risks posed by uncontrolled burning of used oil in space heaters within areas
where blue collar employees are working. Because of the nature and economics of the automotive and industrial
workplaces where this practice is employed and the general demographic of the lower income employees who are
employed in those settings, these workplaces are generally in environmentally overburdened, underserved and
economically‐distressed communities and in lower income neighborhoods where the bulk of those workers reside.

The current EPA policy enabling the combustion of used oil in small space heaters – developed originally in the 1980’s
and 1990’s – results in the emissions of toxic heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium, chromium and other harmful
GHG’s. With little or no emission controls, these space heaters produce nearly 90% more emissions than would occur if
the used oil were re‐refined for sustainable use, and often expose workers to other harmful carcinogens due to a lack of
proper ventilation. EPA estimates this practice burns approximately 150 million gallons of used oil per year (EPA/625/R‐
94/010). Furthermore, with no way to police what other harmful materials may also be incinerated in those workplace
space heaters, it is difficult to determine the compounded environmental and health impacts of such emissions on the
blue collar employees working there and on the residents living nearby.

This practice is inconsistent with the technological and regulatory advances we have made in the United States since the
1980’s‐ and 1990”s and essentially constitutes an outdated Third World Practice in America at a time when we have
been called to action to deter global warming. As far back as the Regan Administration, EPA Assistant Administrator
Winston Porter expressed concern about the risks of space heathers and stated in part on September 22, 1988 – “….we
are concerned about the risks posed by improperly maintained or operated spaces heaters” and he suggested a need
to develop technical standards and regulatory measures to deal with those risks – “….and further evaluate regulatory
options to address risks posed by space heaters.” (RCRA Permit Policy Compendium, EPA/530‐SW‐91‐0621, pp137‐
138).

As EPA moves its next plan toward environmental justice over the next 5 years it is time to give consideration to those
economically distressed workers who have been denied environmental justice by toiling in workplaces that contain
noxious emissions from space heaters at a time when it is no longer necessary to use those heaters as a source of heat
when our energy resources are expanding to cleaner, safer and healthier options. Certainly, nearly 30 years after the
EPA expressed legitimate concerns about this practice, these economically underprivileged workers deserve to be better
protected than they have been and as well protected as those of us who work in offices. This issue should certainly be
part of the framework for EJ 2020.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:                             Comments on 2020 EJ Strategy


To whom it may concern,

This provides commentary to the EJ 2020 Action Framework.

               The framework does not appear to engage state government to coordinate with their EJ efforts if
                any. For example, collaborative processes with ITRC, ECOS or ASTSWMO should be contemplated.
               The framework does not coordinate with corporate responsibility. Corporations are often potentially
                responsible parties, and many hold a common ethic. The agency should seek to build common purpose
                in EJ matters with the business community.
               An area of focus that I participate in is long term stewardship of contaminated land. This would
                affect RCRA and Superfund facilities. We implement an objective to be ""protective"" presuming the
                remediation is complete. The ingredients we work with are institutional and engineering
                controls. There is an EJ interest that these controls be just in their selection, effective in use, and
                maintain their integrity. Often there are groundwater plumes that are left after remedies are complete
                that are unprotected by institutional or engineering controls. The ability to discover and apply
                information about institutional and engineering controls adversely impacts overburdened
                communities. Legal descriptions used are not accessible, the restrictions on use are hidden in complex
                legal language or orders. EJ efforts should encourage making IC and EC information understandable
                and discoverable.
               Often impacted communities do the construction jobs that would cause them to contact residuals, or
                perhaps have occupancies that are unsafe. EJ efforts should embrace technologies that can monitor land
                activity and use in impacted communities, and provide active notice when a construction worker or
                tenant is going to contact residuals. For example, the excavation clearance systems can provide notice
                to an excavator of contact with residuals in multiple languages. Or, daycare licensing can be tracked
                against areas of known contamination. The embedded theory is to ""push"" information to members of
                overburdened communities, rather than to expect the community member to ""pull"" information from an
                agency website. The strategy does not appear to embrace ""push"" information flow, and this can
                provide a extra safety net in these communities. The fees and scales of these technologies are very
                reasonable, and they generate metrics that can provide information for effectiveness of EJ efforts.
               The strategy should embrace the role of the private sector to develop communication tools. The
                USEPA should carry a focus on quality of data, enhancing the metadata, and allow the private sector to
                make innovative tools to serve the EJ mission. Too often the agency inadvertently hinders innovation
                by making portals that make access to information difficult for the application community or preempt
                the role of the innovator.
               The agency has multiple initiatives, and from the outside it is difficult to see if there is any connection
                or master plan. For example, how does EJ 2020 connect to Next Generation compliance or Corrective
                Action 2020.

Thank you for allowing the chance to provide input. Please allow me to clarify any remarks if they seem
unclear. I also apologize for any grammar errors in these remarks.

As background. I am a civil engineer with 35 years practice. I was chair person of ASTM Continuing
Obligations standard. I have generated several environmental applications including LandWatch, WhatsDown
and DigClean. Now I am generating a standard for depiction of groundwater plume maps to facilitate local
                                                                 1
